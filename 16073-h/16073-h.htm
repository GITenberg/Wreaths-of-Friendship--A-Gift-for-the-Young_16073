"Ornamented 'Y'"></a> oung friends&mdash;stop a moment. We have set up a
sort of turnpike gate here, as you see, between the title-page and
the first story in our book, in the shape of a preface, or
introduction. "What! do you mean to take toll of us, then?" Why,
no&mdash;not exactly. But we want to say half a dozen words to you, as
you pass along, and to tell you a little about these WREATHS
which we have been twining for our friends. So you need not be in
quite so great a hurry. Wait a minute.</p>

<p align="justify">You have no doubt noticed that it is a very
common thing for an author to take up several of the first pages of
his book with apologies to his readers. First, perhaps, he
apologizes for writing at all; and secondly, for writing so
poorly&mdash;just as if it was a crime to make a book, for which crime
the author must get down on his knees, and humbly beg the public's
pardon. We think we shall not take this course, on the whole, for
this reason, if for no other&mdash;that we do not feel very guilty about
what we have done. But as the plan of our book is somewhat new, we
have been thinking it would be well enough, in introducing it to
you, at least to tell how we came to make it.</p>

<p align="justify">We have both of us published a good deal, in one
way and another, for young people; and we got a notion&mdash;a very
pleasant one, certainly, and rather natural, withal, whether well
founded or not&mdash;that among that class of the public composed of
boys and girls, we had a pretty respectable number of friends.
Under this impression, we put our heads together, one day, and made
up our minds to invite these friends of ours, every one of them, to
a kind of festival, and that we would share equally in the pleasure
of giving the entertainment. The book, reader, which we have named
WREATHS OF FRIENDSHIP, as perhaps you have already guessed,
grew out of that plan of ours.</p>

<p align="justify">We have not, as you will perceive, indicated the
authorship of the tales and sketches, as they appear; and those
readers who have any curiosity in this matter, are referred to the
index.</p>

<p align="justify">We hope the volume will please you. More than
this: we hope it will prove to be useful&mdash;useful for the future as
well as for the present life; and, indeed, if it had not been for
this hope, much as we love to entertain our young friends, these
Wreaths would never have been twined by our hands.</p>

<p align="justify">We have little else to add, except the fondest
wishes of our hearts; and, to tell the truth, it was to express to
you these kind wishes&mdash;to give you something like a hearty shake of
the hand&mdash;rather than because we had any thing of importance to say
in our preface, that we stopped you at the outset.</p>

<h2>WHAT SHALL WE BUILD?</h2>

<p align="justify"><a href="images/0129.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0129.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt=
"Ornamented 'F'"></a> our children were playing on the sea-shore.
They had gathered bright pebbles and beautiful shells, and written
their names in the pure, white sand; but at last, tired of their
sport, they were about going home, when one of them, as they came
to a pile of stones, cried out:</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh! let us build a fort; and we will call that
ship away out there, an enemy's vessel, and make believe we are
firing great cannon balls into her!"</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes, yes! let us build a fort," responded
Edward, the other lad.</p>

<p align="justify">And the two boys&mdash;for two were boys and two
girls&mdash;ran off to the pile of stones, and began removing them to a
place near the water.</p>

<p align="justify">"Come, Anna and Jane," said they, "come and
help us."</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, no. Don't let us build a fort," said Jane.</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="images/0140.jpg"><img src="images/thumb/0140.jpg" border="0" alt="WHAT SHALL WE BUILD?">
</a><br>WHAT SHALL WE BUILD?</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes; we will build a fort," returned the boys.
"What else can we build? You wouldn't put a house down here upon
the water's edge?"</p>

<p align="justify">"No; but I'll tell you what we can build, and it
will be a great deal better than a fort."</p>

<p align="justify">"Well; what can we build?"</p>

<p align="justify">"A light-house," said the girls; "and that will
be just as much in place on the edge of the sea as a fort. We can
call the ship yonder a vessel lost in the darkness, and we will
hang out a light and direct her in the true way. Won't that be much
better than to call her an enemy, and build a fort to destroy her?
See how beautifully she sits upon and glides over the smooth water!
Her sails are like the open wings of a bird, and they bear her
gracefully along. Would it not be cruel to shoot great balls into
her sides, tear her sails to pieces, and kill the men who are on
board of her? Oh! I am sure it would make us all happier to save
her when in darkness and danger. No, no; let us not build a fort,
but a light-house; for it is better to save than to destroy."</p>

<p align="justify">The girls spoke with tenderness and enthusiasm,
and their words reached the better feelings of their
companions.</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, yes," said they; "we will build a
light-house, and not a fort." And they did so.</p>

<p align="justify">Yes, it is much better to save than to destroy.
Think of that, children, and let it go with you through life. Be
more earnest to save your friends than to destroy your enemies. And
yet, when a real enemy comes, and seeks to do evil, be brave to
resist him.</p>

<a name="016"></a>
<h2>THE TWO COUSINS;</h2>

<h3>OR, HOW TO ACT WHEN "THINGS GO WRONG."</h3>

<p align="justify">"<a href="images/0154.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0154.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt=
"Ornamented 'T'"></a> here, mother, I knew it would be so. Lucy
Wallace has just sent over to tell me she can't walk out in the
woods with me. There's no use in my trying to please any
body&mdash;there's no use in it. I'm an odd sort of a creature, it
seems. Nobody loves me. It always was so. Oh, dear! I wish I knew
what I had done to make the girls hate me so!"</p>

<p align="justify">This not very good-natured speech was made by a
little girl, whom I shall call Angeline Standish. She was some ten
or twelve years old, as near as I can recollect. Perhaps my readers
would like to know something about the occasion which called for
this speech; but it is a long story, and hardly worth telling. The
truth is, when little boys and girls get very angry, or peevish, or
fretful, they sometimes blow out a great deal of ill-humor,
something after the manner that an overcharged steam boiler lets
off steam&mdash;with this difference, however, that the steam boiler
gets cooler by the operation, while the boy or girl gets more
heated. The throat is a poor safety-valve for ill-humor; and it is
bad business, this setting the tongue agoing at such a rate,
whenever the mercury in one's temper begins to rise toward the
boiling point.</p>

<p align="justify">As is usual, in such cases, Angeline felt worse
after these words had whistled through the escape pipe of her
ill-nature, than she did before; and, for want of something else to
do, she commenced crying. She was not angry&mdash;that is, not
altogether so&mdash;though the spirit she showed was a pretty good
imitation of anger, it must be confessed. She was peevish. Matters
had not gone right with her that day. She was crossed in this thing
and that thing. Her new hat had not come home from the milliner's,
as she expected; one of her frocks had just got badly torn; she had
a hard lesson to learn; and I cannot repeat the whole catalogue of
her miseries. So she fretted, and stormed, and cried, and felt just
as badly as she chose.</p>

<p align="justify">Not long after the crying spell was over, and
there was a little blue sky in sight, Jeannette Forrest, a cousin
of Angeline's, came running into the room, her face all lighted up
with smiles, and threw her arms around her cousin's neck, and
kissed her. This was no uncommon thing with Jeannette. She had a
very happy and a very affectionate disposition. Every body loved
her, and she loved every body.</p>

<p align="justify">One not acquainted with Angeline, might very
naturally suppose that she would return her cousin's embrace. But
she did no such thing. Her manner was quite cool and distant. Human
nature is a strange compound, is it not?</p>

<p align="justify">"Why, cousin," said the light-hearted Jeannette,
"what is the matter? You are not well, are you?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes, well enough," the other replied, rather
crustily. Take care, Angeline, there's a cloud coming over your
cousin's face. Speak a kind word or two, now. Then the sun will
beam out again, brightly as ever. Jeannette was silent for a
moment, for she was astonished, and did not know what to make of
her cousin's manner. It would have appeared uncivil and rude to
most little girls. But the sweet spirit of Jeannette&mdash;loving,
hoping, trusting&mdash;was differently affected. She saw only the
brighter side of the picture. So the bee, as she flies merrily from
flower to flower, finds a store of honey where others would find
only poison.</p>

<p align="justify">"Dear Angeline," said her cousin, at length,
"I'm sure something is the matter. Tell me what it is, won't you?
Oh, I should love to make you happy, if I only knew how!"</p>

<p align="justify">Angeline seemed scarcely to hear these words of
love. That is strange enough, I hear you say. So it is, perhaps,
and it may be stranger still, that she read not the language of
love and sympathy that was written so plainly in her cousin's
countenance. It is true, though, for all that. She did not say much
of any thing to this inquiry&mdash;she simply muttered, between her
teeth,</p>

<p align="justify">"I don't believe any body loves me."</p>

<p align="justify">Jeannette was no philosopher. She could not read
essays nor preach sermons. Her argument to convince her cousin that
there was, at least, one who loved her, was drawn from the heart,
rather than from the head. It was very brief, and very much to the
point. She burst into tears, and sobbed,</p>

<p align="justify">"Don't say so, dear."</p>

<p align="justify">Jeannette could not stay long. Her mother had
sent her on an errand, and told her she must make haste back.
Perhaps it was as well that she could not stay&mdash;and perhaps not.
Human nature is a strange sort of compound, as I said before; and
it may be that the ice which had covered over the streams leading
from Angeline's heart would not have melted under the influence
even of the warm sun that, for a moment or two, beamed upon them so
kindly. For one, however, I should like to know what would have
come out of that conversation, if it had been allowed to go on.
Jeannette went home, and Angeline was again left to her own
reflections, which were any thing but pleasant. It was Saturday
afternoon; and, there being no school, she had hoped to be able to
ramble in the woods with some of her little companions. But here
she was disappointed, too, and this increased her peevishness;
though the reason why she could not go was, because she did not
learn her lesson in season, and that was her own fault. Toward
night, when Mrs Standish had leisure to sit down to her sewing, she
called Angeline, and reminded her of the ill-natured spirit she had
shown in the early part of the afternoon. The child was rather
ashamed of what she had said, it is true; but she tried to excuse
her conduct.</p>

<p align="justify">"Every thing went wrong to-day, mother," she
said; "I couldn't help feeling so. Oh, dear! I don't see how any
body can be good, when things go in this way&mdash;I mean any body but
Jeannette. I wish I was like her. It is easy for her to be
good."</p>

<p align="justify">"Your cousin has, no doubt, a very different
disposition from yours," said the mother. "But it is much easier
for you to be always good-natured and happy than you suppose,
Angeline."</p>

<p align="justify">"I wish I knew how, mother."</p>

<p align="justify">"Well, you say things went wrong with you this
afternoon. I think I know what some of these things were. They were
not so pleasant as they might have been, certainly. They were
troublesome. But don't you think the greatest trouble of all was in
your own heart?"</p>

<p align="justify">"No, ma'am. I was well enough until the things
began to go wrong; and then I felt bad, and I couldn't help
it."</p>

<p align="justify">Mrs Standish laughed, as she said, "So, then, as
soon as the things begin to go wrong, you take the liberty to go
wrong too. Every thing works well inside, until it is disturbed by
something outside?"</p>

<p align="justify">"That is it, mother."</p>

<p align="justify">"And when the things inside go smoothly, because
every thing is smooth outside, you have a very good and happy
disposition?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Pretty good, I think."</p>

<p align="justify">"And so, when there is a hurricane inside,
because the wind blows rather more than usual outside, you are
cross, and unhappy, and bad enough to make up for being so good
before?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes, ma'am, I am afraid I am, sometimes."</p>

<p align="justify">"No, my child, you are wrong, all wrong. If all
was right inside, the other things you speak of would not disturb
you so, if they should happen to go wrong."</p>

<p align="justify">"Why, mother, wouldn't they disturb me at
all?"</p>

<p align="justify">"They might, occasionally, but not near as much.
Do you remember that our clock went wrong last winter?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes, ma'am; we couldn't tell what time it was,
and it used to strike all sorts of ways."</p>

<p align="justify">"What do you suppose made the clock act so,
Angeline? It goes well enough now, you know."</p>

<p align="justify">"I believe Mr Mercer said one of the wheels was
out of order."</p>

<p align="justify">"That was all. It was not the weather&mdash;not
because we forgot to wind it up&mdash;not because things did not go
right in the room. Now, your mind is something like a clock. If it
is kept in order, it will run pretty well, I guess&mdash;no matter
whether it rains or shines&mdash;whether it is winter or summer. Milton
says, very beautifully, in his poem called the 'Paradise Lost,'</p>

<blockquote>"'The mind is its own place, and of itself<br>
 Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.'</blockquote>

<p align="justify">"He means by this, that our happiness or
unhappiness depends more upon what is within us than it does upon
what is without. And he is right. Do you understand, my child?"</p>

<p align="justify">"I understand what you mean, but it is not so
easy to see how I am to go to work and be good all the time, like
cousin Jeannette. I'm not like her, mother, and I never can be like
her, I know."</p>

<p align="justify">"True, you will always be very unlike your
cousin. But I don't know of any thing to hinder your being as good
and amiable as she is, for all that."</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, mother! I'd give every thing in the world,
if I only knew how!"</p>

<p align="justify">"I think you can learn, my child, with much less
expense; though, to be sure, you will have to give up some things
that perhaps you will find it hard to part with. You will be
obliged to give up some of your bad habits."</p>

<p align="justify">"That would be easy enough."</p>

<p align="justify">"Not so easy as you think, it may be. It is a
good deal easier to let a bad habit come in, than it is to turn one
out. But 'where there's a will, there's a way,' you know."</p>

<p align="justify">"Well, mother, what shall I do? I should like to
begin pretty soon, for scarcely any body loves me now,"</p>

<p align="justify">"Before you learn much, it might be well to
unlearn a little. When any thing goes wrong, as you say, you must,
at least, not make it go worse. You must not make every body around
you unhappy, if you do feel a little cross and peevish."</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, mother, I can't speak pleasantly when I
don't feel so."</p>

<p align="justify">"Then, in most cases, you had better not speak
at all."</p>

<p align="justify">"I never thought of that. I can stop talking, if
I try."</p>

<p align="justify">"So you can, and you can do more. You can get
into the habit of finding 'the south or sunny side of things,' as
Jean Paul says, and if you do, you will not be likely to have a
snow-storm in your heart very often. Besides, you ought to
remember, that all these disappointments and crosses are a part of
your education for heaven, and you should endeavor to improve them
as such, so that their good effect will not be lost. And another
thing, my child: you ought to ask God to assist you in this
self-government&mdash;to make you his child&mdash;to give you a new heart&mdash;to
teach you to love Christ, and to be like him. Then you will seldom
feel cross and fretful, because things go wrong. You will be
cheerful and good-natured. You will make others happy&mdash;and you will
very soon forget the old story, that nobody loves you."</p>

<p align="justify">Now, many little boys and girls&mdash;possibly some
who read this story&mdash;would have thought this task too hard. They
would have regarded it as a pretty severe penance. Perhaps they
would have concluded, after having put all these difficult things
into one scale, and the thing to be gained by them into the other,
that the reward was not worth so great a sacrifice. So thought not
Angeline, however. She began the work in earnest, that very day.
She went over to her uncle's, with an unusual amount of sunshine in
her countenance, and made it all right with Jeannette. In the
evening, she told her little brother James what she intended to do,
and invited him to help her; and before they retired to rest that
night, they knelt down together and offered up a prayer, that God,
for Christ's sake, would help them in governing themselves.</p>

<p align="justify">One day&mdash;perhaps some six weeks after this&mdash;Mrs
Standish said, smilingly, to her daughter,</p>

<p align="justify">"Well, my dear, does Lucy Wallace love you any
better?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, mother," said Angeline, as a tear of joy
stood in her eye, "every body loves me now!"</p>

<h2>A NOBLE ACT.</h2>

<p align="justify">"What have you there, boys?" asked Captain
Bland.</p>

<p align="justify">"A ship," replied one of the lads who were
passing the captain's neat cottage.</p>

<p align="justify">"A ship! Let me see;" and the captain took the
little vessel, and examined it with as much fondness as a child
does a pretty toy. "Very fair, indeed; who made it?"</p>

<p align="justify">"I did," replied one of the boys.</p>

<p align="justify">"You, indeed! Do you mean to be a sailor,
Harry?"</p>

<p align="justify">"I don't know. I want father to get me into the
navy."</p>

<p align="justify">"As a midshipman?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes, sir."</p>

<p align="justify">Captain Bland shook his head.</p>

<p align="justify">"Better be a farmer, a physician, or a
merchant."</p>

<p align="justify">"Why so, captain?" asked Harry;</p>

<p align="justify">"All these are engaged in the doing of things
directly useful to society."</p>

<p align="justify">"But I am sure, captain, that those who defend
us against our enemies, and protect all who are engaged in commerce
from wicked pirates, are doing what is useful to society."</p>

<p align="justify">"Their use, my lad," replied Captain Bland, "is
certainly a most important one; but we may call it rather negative
than positive. The civilian is engaged in building up and
sustaining society in doing good, through his active employment, to
his fellow-man. But military and naval officers do not produce any
thing; they only protect and defend."</p>

<p align="justify">"But if they did not protect and defend,
captain, evil men would destroy society. It would be of no use for
the civilian to endeavor to build up, if there were none to fight
against the enemies of the state."</p>

<p align="justify">"Very true, my lad. The brave defender of his
country cannot be dispensed with, and we give him all honor. Still,
the use of defence and protection is not so high as the use of
building up and sustaining. The thorn that wounds the hand
stretched forth to pluck the flower, is not so much esteemed, nor
of so much worth, as the blossom it was meant to guard. Still, the
thorn performs a great use. Precisely a similar use does the
soldier or naval officer perform to society; and it will be for
you, my lad, to decide as to which position you would rather
fill."</p>

<p align="justify">"I never thought of that, captain," said one of
the lads. "But I can see clearly how it is. And yet I think those
men who risk their lives for us in war, deserve great honor. They
leave their homes, and remain away, sometimes for years, deprived
of all the comforts and blessings that civilians enjoy, suffering
frequently great hardships, and risking their lives to defend their
country from her enemies."</p>

<p align="justify">"It is all as you say," replied Captain Bland;
"and they do, indeed, deserve great honor. Their calling is one
that exposes them to imminent peril, and requires them to make many
sacrifices; and they encounter not this peril and sacrifice for
their own good, but for the good of others. Their lives do not pass
so evenly as do the lives of men who spend their days in the
peaceful pursuits of business, art, or literature; and we could
hardly wonder if they lost some of the gentler attributes of the
human heart. In some cases, this is so; but in very many cases the
reverse is true. We find the man who goes fearlessly into battle,
and there, in defence of his country, deals death and destruction
unsparingly upon her enemies, acting, when occasion offers, from
the most humane sentiments, and jeopardizing his life to save the
life of a single individual. Let me relate to you a true story in
illustration of what I say.</p>

<p align="justify">"When the unhappy war that has been waged by our
troops in Mexico broke out, a lieutenant in the navy, who had a
quiet berth at Washington, felt it to be his duty to go to the
scene of strife, and therefore asked to be ordered to the Gulf of
Mexico. His request was complied with, and he received orders to go
on board the steamer Mississippi, Commodore Perry, then about to
sail from Norfolk to Vera Cruz.</p>

<p align="justify">"Soon after the Mississippi arrived out, and
before the city and castle were taken, a terrible 'norther' sprung
up, and destroyed much shipping in the harbor. One vessel, on which
were a number of passengers, was thrown high upon a reef, and when
morning broke, the heavy sea was making a clear breach through her.
She lay about a mile from the Mississippi, and it soon became known
on board the steamer, that a mother and her infant were in the
wreck, and that unless succor came speedily, they would perish. The
lieutenant of whom I speak, immediately ordered out a boat's crew,
and although the sea was rolling tremendously, and the 'norther'
still blowing a hurricane, started to the rescue. Right in the
teeth of the wind were the men compelled to pull their boat, and so
slowly did they progress, that it took over two hours to gain the
wreck.</p>

<p align="justify">"At one time, they actually gave out, and the
oars lay inactive in their hands. At this crisis, the brave but
humane officer, pointing with one hand to the fortress of San Juan
de Ulloa, upon which a fire had already commenced, and with the
other to the wreck, exclaimed, with noble enthusiasm,</p>

<p align="justify">"'Pull away, men! I would rather save the life
of that woman and her child, than have the honor of taking the
castle!'</p>

<p align="justify">"Struck by the noble, unselfish, and truly
humane feelings of their officer, the crew bent with new vigor to
their oars. In a little while the wreck was gained, and the brave
lieutenant had the pleasure of receiving into his arms the almost
inanimate form of the woman, who had been lashed to the deck, and
over whom the waves had been beating, at intervals, all night.</p>

<p align="justify">"In writing home to his friends, after the
excitement of the adventure was over, the officer spoke of the
moment when he rescued that mother and child from the wreck as the
proudest of his life.</p>

<p align="justify">"Afterward he took part in the bombardment of
Vera Cruz, and had command, in turn, of the naval battery, where he
faithfully and energetically performed his duty as an officer in
the service of his country. He was among the first of those who
entered the captured city; but pain, not pleasure, filled his mind,
as he looked around, and saw death and destruction on every hand.
Victory had perched upon our banners; the arms of our country had
been successful; the officer had bravely contributed his part in
the work; but he frankly owns that he experienced far more delight
in saving the woman he had borne from the wreck, than he could have
felt had he been the commander of the army that reduced the
city.</p>

<p align="justify">"Wherever duty calls, my lads," concluded the
captain, "you will find that brave officer. He will never shrink
from the post of danger, if his country have need of him; nor will
he ever be deaf to the appeal of humanity; but so long as he is a
true man, just so long will he delight more in saving than in
destroying."</p>

<p align="justify"><a href="images/0067.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0067.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt=
"Ornamented 'W'"></a> illiam Baker, and his brother Thomas and
sister Ellen, were playing on the green lawn in front of their
mother's door, when a lad named Henry Green came along the road,
and seeing the children enjoying themselves, opened the gate and
came in. He was rather an ill-natured boy, and generally took more
pleasure in teasing and annoying others, than in being happy with
them. When William saw him coming in through the gate, he called to
him and said, in a harsh way,</p>

<p align="justify">"You may just clear out, Henry Green, and go
about your business! We don't want you here."</p>

<p align="justify">But Henry did not in the least regard what
William said. He came directly forward, and joined in the sport as
freely as if he had been invited instead of repulsed. In a little
while he began to pull Ellen about rudely, and to push Thomas, so
as nearly to throw them down upon the grass.</p>

<p align="justify">"Go home, Henry Green! Nobody sent for you!
Nobody wants you here!" said William Baker, in quite an angry
tone.</p>

<p align="justify">It was of no use, however. William might as well
have spoken to the wind. His words were entirely unheeded by Henry,
whose conduct became ruder and more offensive.</p>

<p align="justify">Mrs Baker, who sat at the window, saw and heard
all that was passing. As soon as she could catch the eye of her
excited son, she beckoned him to come to her, which he promptly
did.</p>

<p align="justify">"Try kind words on him," she said; "you will
find them more powerful than harsh words. You spoke very harshly to
Henry when he came in, and I was sorry to hear it."</p>

<p align="justify">"It won't do any good, mother. He's a rude, bad
boy, and I wish he would stay at home. Won't you make him go
home?"</p>

<p align="justify">"First go and speak to him in a gentler way than
you did just now. Try to subdue him with kindness."</p>

<p align="justify">William felt that he had been wrong in letting
his angry feelings express themselves in angry words. So he left
his mother and went down upon the lawn, where Henry was amusing
himself by trying to trip the children with a long stick, as they
ran about on the green.</p>

<p align="justify">"Henry," he said, cheerfully and pleasantly, "if
you were fishing in the river, and I were to come and throw stones
in where your line fell, and scare away all the fish, would you
like it?"</p>

<p align="justify">"No, I should not," the lad replied.</p>

<p align="justify">"It wouldn't be kind in me?"</p>

<p align="justify">"No, of course it wouldn't."</p>

<p align="justify">"Well, now, Henry," William tried to smile and
to speak very pleasantly, "we are playing here and trying to enjoy
ourselves. Is it right for you to come and interrupt us by tripping
our feet, pulling us about, and pushing us down? I am sure you will
not think so if you reflect a moment. So don't do it any more,
Henry."</p>

<p align="justify">"No, I will not," replied Henry, promptly. "I am
sorry that I disturbed you. I didn't think what I was doing. And
now I remember, father told me not to stay, and I must run
home."</p>

<p align="justify">So Henry Green went quickly away, and the
children were left to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p align="justify">"Didn't I tell you that kind words were more
powerful than harsh words, William?" said his mother, after Henry
had gone away; "when we speak harshly to our fellows, we arouse
their angry feelings, and then evil spirits have power over them;
but when we speak kindly, we affect them with gentleness, and good
spirits flow into this latter state, and excite in them better
thoughts and intentions. How quickly Henry changed, when you
changed your manner and the character of your language. Do not
forget this, my son. Do not forget, that kind words have double the
power of harsh ones."</p>

<p>A Heron once came&mdash;I can scarcely tell why&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the court of his cousins, the fishes,<br>
With despatches, so heavy he scarcely could fly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his bosom brimfull of good wishes.<br>
<br>
He wished the poor Herrings no harm, he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there seemed to be cause for suspicion;<br>
His government wished to convert them, instead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And this was the end of his mission.<br>
<br>
The Herrings replied, and were civil enough,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though a little inclined to be witty:<br>
"We know we are heathenish, savage, and rough,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And are greatly obliged for your pity.<br>
<br>
"But your plan of conversion we beg to decline,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all due respect for your nation;<br>
No doubt it would tend to exalt and refine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we fear it would check respiration."<br>
<br>
The Heron returned to his peers in disdain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And told how their love was requited.<br>
"Poor creatures!" they said, "shall we let them remain<br>

Then soon on a crusade of love and good-will<br>

<h2>EARLY SPRING FLOWERS.</h2>

<p align="justify"><a href="images/0043.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0043.jpg" border="0" alt=
"EARLY SPRING FLOWERS. and a Ornamented 'O'"></a>f all the
amusements of my childhood, I can think of none which I loved so
much as rambling in the woods and meadows among the flowers. What a
rich treat it used to be, just after the earth had thrown aside its
white mantle, and begun to be clothed in its summer dress, to get
permission to spend a whole Saturday afternoon in the woods with my
brother and sister. Oh, how delighted we all were, when we found
the first wild flowers of spring! Let me see. What flowers show
their pretty faces the earliest? Do you remember, young friend?
Perhaps you have always lived in the city, and have never made
their acquaintance. But if you have ever seen them, blushing in
their native haunts, I am sure you must remember how they look, and
what their names are. I cannot see how any body can forget them,
they are so beautiful and lovely.</p>

<p align="justify">One of the earliest flowers of spring, and one
which grew in the woods only a few rods from my father's door, near
the stream that turned my miniature water-wheels, is the
<i>Trailing Arbutus</i>. Often you may find this plant unfolding
its delicate blossoms before the snow has left the ground. That, in
our northern latitudes, is usually among the first flowers in
blossom. Soon after she appears, you may see one and perhaps two
different species of the <i>Anemone</i>. One, especially&mdash;the
<i>Anemone Thalictroides</i>, as it used to be called in botany,
though it is now the <i>Thalictrum Anemonoides</i>, I believe&mdash;is
among the fairest of all these flowers of spring. She has a blossom
as white as snow. The <i>Anemone Nemrosa</i> is almost as fair,
too, though not quite, I think. You can sometimes see them both
smiling side by side, early in the month of May, nodding gracefully
at each other, and smiling as if they were very happy. It does not
require much imagination to fancy they are conversing together;
and, indeed, I would quite as soon believe that flowers could talk,
as I would believe those stories about the fairies that children
hear sometimes.</p>

<p align="justify">There is another beautiful flower which makes
her appearance very early&mdash;the <i>Spring Beauty</i>, or
<i>Claytonia Virginica</i>. She is usually found in the same
locations with the Anemone. Then there is the <i>Liver Leaf</i>.
Did you ever find that, little girl? Very possibly you have not
taken a ramble early enough in the spring to see her. She makes her
visit frequently in the latter part of April, and she does not stay
long. But after her flower has faded and fallen, there may be seen
a few deeply notched and curious leaves, to mark the spot where she
bloomed so sweetly.</p>

<p align="justify">The <i>Blood Root</i>, too, will make her visit,
and go away again, if you delay your ramble in the woods till the
first of May. The blossom of the Blood Root is a very delicate
white. Hundreds of exotic flowers are cultivated in our gardens,
and very much admired, that are not half so pretty as this. The
leaves that appear before the plant is in blossom, are oval, a
little like those of the Adder's Tongue, which is in flower
somewhat later, and like those of one species of the Solomon's
Seal&mdash;the <i>Convallaria Bifolia</i>. But when the flower of the
Blood Root appears, you see quite a different kind of leaf, so that
even close observers of wild flowers are sometimes deceived, and
think that their early leaves belong to some other plant.</p>

<p align="justify">Every body who has been at all familiar with the
forest and meadows in the spring, knows the <i>Violet</i>. There
are a good many sisters in this charming family, but none, perhaps,
in our latitude, that are more beautiful than the <i>Viola
Rotundifolia,</i> or Yellow Violet, with roundish leaves, lying
close to the ground. The Blue Violet, too, appears soon after, and
is perhaps equally pretty. I recollect distinctly where it used to
grow near the little brook that ran through our meadow&mdash;a brook
that many a time has served to turn my water-wheel. Oh, those days
of miniature water-wheels, and kites, and wind-mills! how happy
they were, and how I love to think of them now! By the way, have
you ever read Miss Gould's poetical fable about the little child
and the Blue Violet? I must recite a stanza or two of this poem, I
think. The child speaks to the Violet, and says,</p>

<p>"Violet, violet, sparkling with dew,<br>
Down in the meadow land, wild where you grew,<br>
How did you come by the beautiful blue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With which your soft petals unfold?<br>
And how do you hold up your tender young head,<br>
Where rude, sweeping winds rush along o'er your bed,<br>
And dark, gloomy clouds, ranging over you, shed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their waters, so heavy and cold?<br>
<br>
"No one has nursed you, or watched you an hour,<br>
Or found you a place in the garden or bower;<br>
And they cannot yield me so lovely a flower,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As here I have found at my feet!<br>
<br>
"Speak, my sweet violet, answer and tell,<br>
How you have grown up and flourished so well,<br>
And look so contented, where lonely you dwell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we thus by accident meet?"</p>

<p align="justify">Then the Violet answers, and tells the child why
it is so contented, and how it is able to hold up its head, and
where its pretty blue petals come from. But I will not recite the
remainder of the poem, for I am sure my readers do not need to be
told who made the flowers, and who taught them to bloom so sweetly
in their wild haunts.</p>

<p align="justify">The early flowers of spring! I loved them fondly
when a child; but now I am a man, I love them still more. Shall I
tell you why, dear child? There is something sad in the reason, and
yet it is not all sadness. I had a sister&mdash;I <i>had</i> a sister.
Ah! that tells the tale. I have no sister now! The dearest
companion of my early rambles among the flowers&mdash;herself the
fairest and sweetest of them all&mdash;has fallen before the scythe of
Death. She has gone now to a world of perpetual spring, and the
flowers she loved so well are blooming over her grave. She faded
away in the early spring, and we laid her to rest where her mother
had long been sleeping. By the side of the streamlet where we used
to play in the sunny days of childhood, and where the Dandelion
grew, and the Butter-cup, and the Violet&mdash;there is now the form of
her I tenderly loved.</p>

<p align="justify">But my strain is sad&mdash;too sad. I will sing, and
be cheerful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! how soon<br>
The things of earth we love most fondly perish!<br>
Why died the flower our hearts had learned to cherish?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, ere 'twas noon?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot tell&mdash;<br>
But though the grave be that loved sister's dwelling,<br>
And though my heart e'en now with grief is swelling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know 'tis well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis well with the&mdash;<br>
'Tis well with thee, thou lone and silent sleeper!<br>
'Tis well, though thou hast left me here a weeper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awhile to be.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis well for me&mdash;<br>
'Tis well; my home, since thou art gone, is dearer&mdash;<br>
The grave is welcome, if it bring me nearer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To heaven and thee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll not repine&mdash;<br>
No, blest one; thou art happier than thy brother:<br>
I'll think of thee, as with thy angel-mother,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet sister mine.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still would I share<br>
Thy love, and meet thee where the flowers are springing,<br>
Where the wild bird his joyous note is singing&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to me there.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! come again,<br>
At the still hour, the holy hour of even,<br>
Ere one pale star has gemmed the vault of heaven;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to me then.</p>

<h2>TEMPTATION RESISTED.</h2>

<p align="justify">Charles Murray left home, with his books in his
satchel, for school. Before starting, he kissed his little sister,
and patted Juno on the head, and as he went singing away, he felt
as happy as any little boy could wish to feel. Charles was a
good-tempered lad, but he had the fault common to a great many
boys, that of being tempted and enticed by others to do things
which he knew to be contrary to the wishes of his parents. Such
acts never made him feel any happier; for the fear that his
disobedience would be found out, and the consciousness of having
done wrong, were far from being pleasant companions.</p>

<p align="justify">On the present occasion, as he walked briskly in
the direction of the school, he repeated over his lessons in his
mind, and was intent upon having them so perfect as to be able to
repeat every word. He had gone nearly half the distance, and was
still thinking over his lessons, when he stopped suddenly, as a
voice called out,</p>

<p align="justify">"Halloo, Charley!"</p>

<p align="justify">Turning in the direction from which the voice
came, he saw Archy Benton, with his school basket in his hand; but
he was going from, instead of in the direction of the school.</p>

<p align="justify">"Where are you going, Archy?" asked Charles,
calling out to him.</p>

<p align="justify">"Into the woods, for chestnuts."</p>

<p align="justify">"Ain't you going to school, to-day?"</p>

<p align="justify">"No, indeed. There was a sharp frost last night,
and Uncle John says the wind will rattle down the chestnuts like
hail."</p>

<p align="justify">"Did your father say you might go?"</p>

<p align="justify">"No, indeed. I asked him, but he said I couldn't
go until Saturday. But the hogs are in the woods, and will eat the
chestnuts all up, before Saturday. So I am going to-day. Come, go
along, won't you? It is such a fine day, and the ground will be
covered with chestnuts. We can get home at the usual time, and no
one will suspect that we were not at school."</p>

<p align="justify">"I should like to go, very well," said Charley;
"but I know father will be greatly displeased, if he finds it out,
and I am afraid he will get to know it, in some way."</p>

<p align="justify">"How could he get to know it? Isn't he at his
store all the time?"</p>

<p align="justify">"But he might think to ask me if I was at
school. And I never will tell a lie."</p>

<p align="justify">"You could say yes, and not tell a lie, either,"
returned Archy. "You were at school yesterday."</p>

<p align="justify">"No, I couldn't. A lie, father says, is in the
intent to deceive. He would, of course, mean to ask whether I was
at school to-day, and if I said yes, I would tell a lie."</p>

<p align="justify">"It isn't so clear to me that you would. At any
rate, I don't see such great harm in a little fib. It doesn't hurt
any body."</p>

<p align="justify">"Father says a falsehood hurts a boy a great
deal more than he thinks for. And one day he showed me in the Bible
where liars were classed with murderers, and other wicked spirits,
in hell. I can't tell a lie, Archy."</p>

<p align="justify">"There won't be any need of your doing so,"
urged Archy; "for I am sure he will never think to ask you about
it. Why should he?"</p>

<p align="justify">"I don't know. But whenever I have been doing
any thing wrong, he is sure to begin to question me, and lead me on
until I betray the secret of my fault."</p>

<p align="justify">"Never mind. Come and go with me. It is such a
fine day. We shan't have another like it. It will rain on Saturday,
I'll bet any thing. So come along, now, and let us have a day in
the woods, while we can."</p>

<p align="justify">Charles was very strongly tempted. When he
thought of the confinement of school, and then of the freedom of a
day in the woods, he felt much inclined to go with Archy.</p>

<p align="justify">"Come along," said Archy, as Charles stood
balancing the matter in his mind. And he took hold of his arm, and
drew him in a direction opposite from the school. "Come! you are
just the boy I want. I was thinking about you the moment before I
saw you."</p>

<p align="justify">The temptation to Charles was very strong. "I
don't believe I will be found out," he said to himself; "and it is
such a pleasant day to go into the woods!"</p>

<p align="justify">Still he held back, and thought of his father's
displeasure if he should discover that he had played the truant.
The word "truant," that he repeated mentally, decided the matter in
his mind, and he exclaimed, in a loud and decided voice, as he
dragged away from the hand of Archy, that had still retained its
hold on his arm, "I've never played truant yet, and I don't think I
ever will. Father says he never played truant when he was a boy;
and I'd like to say the same thing when I get to be a man."</p>

<p align="justify">"Nonsense, Charley! come, go with me," urged
Archy.</p>

<p align="justify">But Charles Murray's mind was made up not to
play the truant. So he started off for school, saying, as he did
so&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"No, I can't go, Archy; and if I were you, I
would wait until Saturday. You will enjoy it so much better when
you have your fathers consent. It always takes away more than half
the pleasure of any enjoyment to think that it is obtained at the
cost of disobedience. Come! go to school with me now, and I will go
into the woods with you on Saturday."</p>

<p align="justify">"No, I can't wait until Saturday. I'm sure it
will rain by that time; and if it don't, the hogs will eat up every
nut that has fallen before that time."</p>

<p align="justify">"There'll be plenty left on the trees, if they
do. It's as fine sport to knock them down as to pick them up."</p>

<p align="justify">But Archy's purpose was settled, and nothing
that Charles Murray could say had any influence with him. So the
boys parted, the one for his school, and the other for a stolen
holiday in the woods.</p>

<p align="justify">The moment Charles was alone again, he felt no
longer any desire to go with Archy. He had successfully resisted
the temptation, and the allurement was gone. But even for listening
to temptation he had some small punishment, for he was late to
school by nearly ten minutes, and had not his lessons as perfect as
usual, for which the teacher felt called upon to reprimand him. But
this was soon forgotten; and he was so good a boy through the whole
day, and studied all his lessons so diligently, that when evening
came, the teacher, who had not forgotten the reprimand, said to
him:</p>

<p align="justify">"You have been the best boy in the school
to-day, Charles. To-morrow morning try and come in time, and be
sure that your lessons are all well committed to memory."</p>

<p align="justify">Charles felt very light and cheerful as he went
running, skipping, and singing homeward. His day had been well
spent, and happiness was his reward. When he came in sight of home,
there was no dread of meeting his father and mother, such as he
would have felt if he had played the truant. Every thing looked
bright and pleasant, and when Juno came bounding out to meet him,
he couldn't help hugging the favorite dog in the joy he felt at
seeing her.</p>

<p align="justify">When Charles met his mother, she looked at him
with a more earnest and affectionate gaze than usual. And then the
boy noticed that her countenance became serious.</p>

<p align="justify">"Ain't you well, mother?" asked Charles.</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes, my dear, I am very well," she replied;
"but I saw something an hour ago which has made me feel sad. Archy
Benton was brought home from the woods this afternoon, where he had
gone for chestnuts, instead of going to school, as he should have
done, dreadfully hurt. He had fallen from a tree. Both his arms are
broken, and the doctor fears that he has received some inward
injury that may cause his death."</p>

<p align="justify">Charles turned pale, when his mother said
this.</p>

<p align="justify">"Boys rarely get hurt, except when they are
acting disobediently, or doing some harm to others," remarked Mrs
Murray. "If Archy had gone to school, this dreadful accident would
not have happened. His father told him that he might go for
chestnuts on Saturday, and if he had waited until then, I am sure
he might have gone into the woods and received no harm, for all who
do right are protected from evil."</p>

<p align="justify">"He tried to persuade me to go with him," said
Charles, "and I was strongly tempted to do so. But I resisted the
temptation, and have felt glad about it ever since."</p>

<p align="justify">Mrs Murray took her son's hand, and pressing it
hard, said, with much feeling,</p>

<p align="justify">"How rejoiced I am that you were able to resist
his persuasions to do wrong. Even if you had not been hurt
yourself, the injury received by Archy would have discovered to us
that you were with him, and then how unhappy your father and I
would have been I cannot tell. And you would have been unhappy,
too. Ah! my son, there is only one true course for all of us, and
that is, to do right. Every deviation from this path brings
trouble. An act of a moment may make us wretched for days, weeks,
months, or perhaps years. It will be a long, long time before Archy
is free from pain of body or mind&mdash;it may be that he will never
recover. Think how miserable his parents must feel; and all because
of this single act of disobedience."</p>

<p align="justify">We cannot say how often Charles said to himself,
that evening and the next day, when he thought of Archy, "Oh, how
glad I am that I did not go with him!"</p>

<p align="justify">When Saturday came, the father and mother of
Charles Murray gave him permission to go into the woods for
chestnuts. Two or three other boys, who were his school companions,
likewise received liberty to go; and they joined Charles, and
altogether made a pleasant party. It did not rain, nor had the hogs
eaten up all the nuts, for the lads found plenty under the tall old
trees, and in a few hours filled their bags and baskets. Charles
said, when he came home, that he had never enjoyed himself better,
and was so glad that he had not been tempted to go with Archy
Benton.</p>

<p align="justify">It was a lesson he never afterward forgot. If he
was tempted to do what he knew was wrong, he thought of Archy's day
in the woods, and the tempter instantly left him. The boy who had
been so badly hurt, did not die, as the doctor feared; but he
suffered great pain, and was ill for a long time.</p>

"images/thumb/0063.jpg" border="0" alt="STRETCHING THE TRUTH."></a><br>STRETCHING THE TRUTH.</p>

<h2>STRETCHING THE TRUTH.</h2>

<p align="justify">It is a very bad habit, this stretching the
truth, as one does a piece of India rubber; and the worst of it is,
that when any body forms the habit, there is no telling how much it
will grow upon him.</p>

<p align="justify">There is Jack Weaver, for instance. He is a
sailor all over, to be sure&mdash;an "old salt," as he would call
himself. But that does not confer upon him any license to spin such
yarns as he does, to his young shipmates on the forward deck. He
has cruised half a dozen years after whales, in the Pacific ocean,
and, of course, has seen some sights that are worth speaking of.
But that is no reason why he should fill the head of that young
fellow sitting on a coil of rope with a hundred cock-and-bull
stories, that have scarcely a word of truth in them, from beginning
to end. Why, he don't pretend to tell stories without stretching
the truth.</p>

<p align="justify">I know some boys, too, who seem to find it very
difficult to relate any incident as it took place. They are so much
in the habit of stretching the truth, in fact, that those who are
acquainted with them seldom believe more than half of one of their
stories. These boys, however, have not the slightest intention,
when they are pulling out a foot into a yard, of doing any thing
wrong. Very possibly they think they are telling a pretty straight
story. Habits are strong, you know&mdash;especially bad habits. Just
look at Selden Mason, one of the best-natured boys I ever saw, and
who has not got an enemy among all his school-mates; it is
wonderful what a truth-stretcher he has got to be. Every boy shakes
his head, when he hears a great story, and says it sounds like one
of Selden's yarns. And yet be is so particular and minute in
relating any thing, sometimes, that one who did not know him would
not suspect him of treating the truth so badly. His apparent
sincerity reminds me of an anecdote related of another boy, who had
this habit worse than Selden has, I should think. The boy remarked
that his father once killed ninety-nine crows at a single shot! He
was asked why he did not say a hundred, and have done with it. The
fellow was indignant. "Do you think I would tell a lie for one
crow?" said he!</p>

<p align="justify">Selden Mason's habit of truth-stretching has got
such a hold of him now, that you can perceive the marks of it in
almost every thing he says. I have sometimes been half sorry he was
so good a boy in other respects; for, as his companions like him
pretty well, there is the more danger that they will catch the
habit of him, before they are aware of it. His teacher was once
asked what he thought of Selden, on the whole. "I can't help being
pleased with the fellow," said he; "he is a good scholar, and very
obedient; but I should like him a great deal better if he didn't
tell such monstrous stories. He is like a book all printed in
italic letters, with an exclamation point at the end of every
sentence." Selden has often gone by the name of the "Exclamation
Point," since that time.</p>

<p align="justify">Poor fellow! I wish he had tried to break
himself of that habit, before it became so deeply rooted. I am
afraid it will stick to him as long as he lives now; and if it
does, he will get a very bad character as a man of business.
Scarcely any reliance can be placed upon his word. No matter how
careful he may be to state a thing exactly as it is, in his
business matters, if he keeps up this general habit, people will
say, "Oh! that's nothing but one of Mason's italic stories!"</p>

<p align="justify">Look out, my boy! It wouldn't be the strangest
thing in the world, if you had got into a habit something like this
of Selden's, though it may not yet be half so strong. But keep a
sharp look-out, at any rate. Take care that you never stretch the
truth.</p>

Wisely by Him who has tamed the heart,<br>
To stir the love for the bright and fair,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes dream<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy glossy wings<br>
Are its brightest image of moving things."</p>

<p align="justify">In the language of the same poet, how often have
we said, as we looked forth upon the gentle bird:</p>

<p>"Stoop to my window, thou beautiful dove;<br>
Thy daily visits have touched my love.<br>
I watch thy coming, and list the note<br>
That stirs so low in thy mellow throat;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my joy is high<br>
To catch the glance of thy gentle eye."</p>

<p align="justify">In his lines to "The Belfry Pigeon," Mr Willis
has expressed most truthfully the feelings and thoughts which all
have had for this gentle creature, which,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alone of the feathered race,<br>
Doth look unscared on the human face."</p>

<p align="justify">As we know of nothing on the subject more
appropriate and beautiful than the address referred to, we will
copy it for our young readers.</p>

<h2>THE BELFRY PIGEON.</h2>

<p>"On the cross beam under the Old South Bell,<br>
The nest of a pigeon is builded well.<br>
In summer and winter that bird is there,<br>
Out and in with the morning air.<br>
I love to see him track the street,<br>
With his wary eye and active feet;<br>
And I often watch him as he springs,<br>
Circling the steeples with easy wings,<br>
Till across the dial his shade has pass'd,<br>
And the belfry edge is gained at last.<br>
'Tis a bird I love, with its brooding note,<br>
And the trembling throb in its mottled throat;<br>
There's a human look in its swelling breast,<br>
And the gentle curve of its lowly crest;<br>
And I often stop with the fear I feel&mdash;<br>
He runs so close to the rapid wheel.<br>
<br>
"Whatever is rung on that noisy bell&mdash;<br>
Chime of the hour or funeral knell&mdash;<br>
The dove in the belfry must hear it well.<br>
When the tongue swings out to the midnight moon&mdash;<br>
When the sexton cheerily rings for noon&mdash;<br>
When the clock strikes clear at morning light&mdash;<br>
When the child is waked with 'nine at night'&mdash;<br>
When the chimes play soft in the Sabbath air,<br>
Filling the spirit with love of prayer&mdash;<br>
Whatever tale in the bell is heard,<br>
He broods on his folded feet unstirr'd,<br>
Or, rising half in his rounded nest,<br>
He takes the time to smooth his breast,<br>
Then drops again with film&eacute;d eyes,<br>
And sleeps as the last vibration dies.<br>
<br>
"Sweet bird! I would that I could be<br>
A hermit in the crowd like thee!<br>
With wings to fly to wood and glen.<br>
Thy lot, like mine, is cast with men,<br>
And daily, with unwilling feet,<br>
I tread, like thee, the crowded street;<br>
But, unlike me, when day is o'er,<br>
Thou canst dismiss the world and soar;<br>
Or, at a half-felt wish for rest,<br>
Canst smooth the feathers on thy breast,<br>
And drop, forgetful, to thy nest."</p>

<h2>A DAY IN THE WOODS.</h2>

<p align="justify">"School!" said Richard White, to himself;
"School! I don't want to go to school. Why am I sent to school
every day? What good is there in learning grammar, and arithmetic,
and geography, and all them things? I don't like school, and I
never did."</p>

<p align="justify">"Dick!" called out a voice; and the lad, who had
seated himself on a cellar door, and placed his satchel beside him,
looked up, and met the cheerful face of one of his
school-fellows.</p>

<p align="justify">"What are you sitting there for, Dick? Don't you
hear the school bell?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes; I hear it, Bill."</p>

<p align="justify">"Then get up and come along, or you will be
late."</p>

<p align="justify">"I don't care if I am. I don't like to go to
school."</p>

<p align="justify">"You don't?"</p>

<p align="justify">"No, indeed. I'd never go to school if I could
help it. What's the use of so much learning? I'm going to a trade
as soon as I get old enough; and Pete Elder says that a boy who
don't know A B C, can learn a trade just as well as one who
does."</p>

<p align="justify">"I don't know any thing about that," replied
William Brown; "but father says, the more learning I get when a
boy, the more successful in life will I be when a man; that is, if
I make a good use of my learning."</p>

<p align="justify">"What good is grammar going to do a mechanic, I
wonder?" said Richard, contemptuously. "What use will the double
rule of three, or fractions, be to him?"</p>

<p align="justify">"They may be of a great deal of use. Father says
we cannot learn too much while we are boys. He says he never
learned any thing in his life that did not come of use to him at
some time or other."</p>

<p align="justify">"Grammar, and geography, and double rule of
three, will never be of any use to me."</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, yes, they will, Dick! So come along. The
bell is nearly done ringing. Come, won't you?"</p>

<p align="justify">"No; I'm going out to the woods,"</p>

<p align="justify">"Come, Richard, come! That will be playing
truant."</p>

<p align="justify">"No; I've made my mind up not to go to school
to-day."</p>

<p align="justify">"You'll be sorry for it, Dick, if you do stay
away from school."</p>

<p align="justify">"Why will I?" said the boy, quickly. "Are you
going to tell?"</p>

<p align="justify">"If I should be asked about you, I will not tell
a lie; but I don't suppose any one will inquire of me."</p>

<p align="justify">"Then why will I be sorry?"</p>

<p align="justify">"You'll be sorry when you're a man."</p>

<p align="justify">Richard White laughed aloud at the idea of his
being sorry when he became a man, for having neglected his school
when a boy.</p>

<p align="justify">"If you are not going, I am," said William
Brown, starting off and running as fast as he could. He arrived at
the door of the schoolhouse just as the bell stopped ringing. In
stopping to persuade Richard not to play truant, he had come near
being too late.</p>

<p align="justify">As soon as William left him, Richard White got
up from the cellar door where he had been reclining lazily, and
throwing his satchel over his shoulder, started for the woods. His
books and satchel were in his way, and rather heavy to carry about
with him for six or seven hours. But he did not think it prudent to
leave them any where, for the person with whom they were left would
suspect him of playing truant, and through that means his fault
might come to the knowledge of his parents.</p>

<p align="justify">After thinking over this, as he went on his way,
it occurred to Richard that the satchel was as likely to betray him
if carried along as if left at some store to be called for on his
return. Finally, he concluded to ask for a newspaper at a shop.</p>

<p align="justify">With this he wrapped up his satchel, and taking
it under his arm, went on without any more fears of betrayal from
this source.</p>

<p align="justify">As soon as the foolish boy reached the woods, he
hid his satchel, so as to get clear of the trouble it was to him,
beside a large stone, and covered it with leaves and long grass.
Then he felt free, and, as he thought, happy.</p>

<p align="justify">But it was not long before he got tired of
rambling about alone. He listened, sometimes, to the birds, and
sometimes tried, with stones, to kill the beautiful and innocent
creatures. Then he thought how pleasant it would be to find a nest,
and carry off the young ones; and he searched with great diligence
for a long time, but could find no nest.</p>

<p align="justify">Once a little striped squirrel glided past him,
and mounted a high tree. As it ran around and around the great
trunk, appearing and disappearing at intervals, Richard tried to
knock it off with stones. But his aim was not very true. Instead of
hitting the squirrel, he managed to get a severe blow himself; for
a stone which he threw very high, struck a large limb, and,
bouncing back, fell upon his upturned face, and cut him badly.</p>

<p align="justify">From that moment, all the pleasure he had felt
since entering the woods was gone. The blood stained his shirt
bosom, and covered his hand when he put it up to his face. Of
course, the wound, and the blood upon his shirt, would betray him.
This was his first thought, as he washed himself at a small stream.
But, then, all at once it occurred to him&mdash;for evil suggestions are
sure to be made to us when we are in the way to receive them&mdash;that
it would be just as easy to say that a boy threw a stone, which
struck him as he was walking along the street, as to say that he
got hurt while in the woods. And, without stopping to think how
wicked it would be to tell a lie, Richard determined to make this
statement when he got home.</p>

<p align="justify">The smarting of the wound, and the uneasiness
occasioned by a sight of the blood, so disturbed Richard's
feelings, that he was unable to regain enough composure of mind to
enjoy his day of freedom in the woods. By twelve o'clock, he was
tired and hungry, and heartily wished himself at home. But it would
not do to go now; for if he were to do so, his father would
understand that he had not been to school. There was no alternative
for him but to remain out in the lonely woods, without any thing to
eat, for five hours longer. And a weary time it was for him.</p>

<p align="justify">At last the sun, which had been for a very long
time, it seemed to him, descending toward the western horizon, sunk
so low that he was sure it must be after five o'clock, and then,
with sober feelings, he started for home. The day had disappointed
him. He was far from feeling happy. When he thought of the wound on
his face and the blood upon his bosom, he felt troubled. If he told
the truth, he knew he would be punished, and if he told a lie, and
was found out, punishment would as certainly follow.</p>

<p align="justify">These were his thoughts and feelings when he
came to the place where he had concealed his satchel. But, lo! his
books were gone. Some one had discovered and carried them off.</p>

<p align="justify">Sadly enough, now, did Richard White return
home. We will not pain our young readers with an account of his
reception. The father already knew that his son had not been to
school, for a man had found the satchel in the woods. Richard's
name was on it, and this led the man to bring it to his father,
with whom he was acquainted.</p>

<p align="justify">Richard never went to school again. On the very
next week, he was sent to learn a trade, and he soon found that
there was a great difference between a school-boy and an
apprentice.</p>

<p align="justify">William Brown continued to go to school two
years longer, when he also went from home to learn a trade. He was
then a good scholar, and had a fondness for books. Because he was
learning a trade, he did not give up all other kinds of learning,
but, whenever he had leisure, he applied himself to his books. Both
he and Richard were free about the same time. Richard had learned
his trade well, and was as good a workman as William; but he had
not improved his mind. He had not been able to see the use that
learning was going to be to a mechanic.</p>

<p align="justify">Fifteen years have passed since these two lads
completed their terms of apprenticeship, and entered the world as
men; and how do they now stand? Why, William Brown has a large
manufactory of his own, and Richard White is one of his workmen. By
his superior intelligence and enterprise, the former is able to
serve the public interests by giving direction to the labors of a
hundred men, and his reward is in proportion to the service he thus
renders; while the latter serves the public interest to the extent
of only one man's labors, and his reward is in exact ratio
thereto.</p>

<p align="justify">Did Richard White gain any thing by his day in
the woods? We think not. Is there any use in education to a
mechanic? Let each of our young readers answer the question for
himself.</p>

<h2>THE SPIDER AND THE HONEY-BEE.</h2>

<h3>A FABLE FOR MANY IN GENERAL AND SOME IN
PARTICULAR.</h3>

<p>I.<br>
<br>
A bee who had chased after pleasure all day,<br>
And homeward was lazily wending his way,<br>
Fell in with a Spider, who called to the Bee:<br>
"Good evening! I trust you are well," said he.<br>
<br>
II.<br>
<br>
The bee was quite happy to stop awhile there&mdash;<br>
For indolence always has moments to spare&mdash;<br>
"Good evening!" he said, with a very low bow,<br>
"My health, sir, alas! 'tis quite delicate now.<br>

<br>
"From spring until autumn, from morning till night,<br>
I'm obliged to be toiling with all my might;<br>
My labors are wearing me out, and you know<br>
I might as well starve, as to kill myself so."<br>
<br>
IV.<br>
<br>
The Spider pretended to pity the Bee&mdash;<br>
For a cunning old hypocrite Spider was he&mdash;<br>
"I'm sorry to see you so ill," he said;<br>
And he whispered his wife, "He will have to be bled."<br>

<br>
"This hoarding of riches&mdash;this wasting of time,<br>

I tremble to think what a miser will do."<br>
<br>
VIII.<br>
<br>
'Tis strange the poor Bee was so stupid and blind.<br>
"Mister Spider," said he, "you have spoken my mind;<br>
There's something within me that seems to say,<br>
I have toiled long enough, and 'tis better to play.<br>

I might beg all my life, and nobody would give.<br>

No Spider, intent on his labor of love,<br>

<br>

"To serve you would give me great pleasure," said he;<br>
"Come into my palace, and tarry with me;<br>
The Spider knows nothing of labor and care.<br>
Come, you shall be welcome our bounty to share.<br>

<br>
XV.<br>
<br>
The Bee did not wait to be urged any more,<br>
But nodded his thanks, as he entered the door.<br>
"Aha!" said the Spider, "I have you at last."<br>
And he caught the poor urchin, and wound him up fast.<br>
<br>
XVI.<br>
<br>
The Bee, when aware of his perilous fate,<br>
Recovered his wit, though a moment too late.<br>
"O treacherous Spider! for shame!" said he,<br>
"Is it thus you betray a poor, innocent Bee?"<br>

<h2>EMMA LEE AND HER SIXPENCE.</h2>

<p align="justify"><a href="images/0088.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0088.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt=
"Ornamented 'E'"></a> mma's aunt had given her a sixpence, and now
the question was, what should she buy with it? "I'll you what I
will do, mother," she said, changing her mind for the tenth
time.</p>

<p align="justify">"Well, dear, what have you determined upon
now?"</p>

<p align="justify">"I'll save my sixpence until I get a good many
more, and then I'll buy me a handsome wax doll. Wouldn't you do
that, mother, if you were me?"</p>

<p align="justify">"If I were you, I suppose I would do just as you
will," replied Emma's mother, smiling.</p>

<p align="justify">"But, mother, don't you think that would be a
nice way to do? I get a good many pennies and sixpences, you know,
and could soon save enough to buy me a beautiful wax doll."</p>

<p align="justify">"I think it would be better," said Mrs Lee, "for
you to save up your money and buy something worth having."</p>

<p align="justify">"Isn't a large wax doll worth having?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, yes! for a little girl like you."</p>

<p align="justify">"Then I'll save up my money, until I get enough
to buy me a doll as big as Sarah Johnson's."</p>

<p align="justify">In about an hour afterward, Emma came to her
mother, and said&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"I've just thought what I will do with my
sixpence. I saw such a beautiful book at a store, yesterday! It was
full of pictures, and the price was just sixpence. I'll buy that
book."</p>

<p align="justify">"But didn't you say, a little while ago, that
you were going to save your money until you had enough to buy a
doll?"</p>

<p align="justify">"I know I did, mother; but I didn't think about
the book then. And it will take so long before I can save up money
enough to get a new doll. I think I will buy the book."</p>

<p align="justify">"Very well, dear," replied Mrs Lee.</p>

<p align="justify">Not long after, Emma changed her mind again.</p>

<p align="justify">On the next day, her mother said to her&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"Your Aunt Mary is quite sick, and I am going to
see her. Do you wish to go with me?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes, mother, I should like to go. I am so sorry
that Aunt Mary is sick. What ails her?"</p>

<p align="justify">"She is never very well, and the least cold
makes her sick. The last time she was here she took cold."</p>

<p align="justify">As they were about leaving the house, Emma
said&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"I'll take my sixpence along, and spend it,
mother."</p>

<p align="justify">"What are you going to buy?" asked Mrs Lee.</p>

<p align="justify">"I don't know," replied Emma. "Sometimes I think
I will buy some cakes; and then I think I will get a whole sixpence
worth of cream candy, I like it so."</p>

<p align="justify">"Have you forgotten the book?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, no! Sometimes I think I will buy the book.
Indeed, I don't know what to buy."</p>

<p align="justify">In this undecided state of mind, Emma started
with her mother to see her aunt. They had not gone far before they
met a poor woman, with some very pretty bunches of flowers for
sale. She carried them on a tray. She stopped before Mrs Lee and
her little girl, and asked if they would not buy some flowers.</p>

<p align="justify">"How much are they a bunch?" asked Emma.</p>

<p align="justify">"Sixpence," replied the woman.</p>

<p align="justify">"Mother! I'll tell you what I will do with my
sixpence," said Emma, her face brightening with the thought that
came into her mind. "I will buy a bunch of flowers for Aunt Mary.
You know how she loves flowers. Can't I do it, mother?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, yes, dear! Do it, by all means, if you
think you can give up the nice cream candy, or the picture book,
for the sake of gratifying your aunt."</p>

<p align="justify">Emma did not hesitate a moment, but selected a
very handsome bunch of flowers, and paid her sixpence to the woman
with a feeling of real pleasure.</p>

<p align="justify">Aunt Mary was very much pleased with the bouquet
Emma brought her.</p>

<p align="justify">"The sight of these flowers, and their
delightful perfume, really makes me feel better," she said, after
she had held them in her hand for a little while; "I am very much
obliged to my niece, for thinking of me."</p>

<p align="justify">That evening, Emma looked up from a book which
her mother had bought her as they returned home from Aunt Mary's,
and with which she had been much entertained, and said&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"I think the spending of my sixpence gave me a
double pleasure."</p>

<p align="justify">"How so, dear?" asked Mrs Lee.</p>

<p align="justify">"I made aunt happy, and the flower woman too.
Didn't you notice how pleased the flower woman looked? I wouldn't
wonder if she had little children at home, and thought about the
bread that sixpence would buy them when I paid it to her. Don't you
think she did?"</p>

<p align="justify">"I cannot tell that, Emma," replied her mother;
"but I shouldn't at all wonder if it were as you suppose. And so it
gives you pleasure to think you have made others happy?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Indeed it does."</p>

<p align="justify">"Acts of kindness," replied Emma's mother,
"always produce a feeling of pleasure. This every one may know. And
it is the purest and truest pleasure we experience in this world.
Try and remember this little incident of the flowers as long as you
live, my child; and let the thought of it remind you that every act
of self-denial brings to the one who makes it a sweet delight."</p>

<h2>UNCLE RODERICK'S STORIES.</h2>

<p align="justify"><a href="images/0093.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0093.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt=
"Ornamented 'U'"></a> ncle Roderick was an old bachelor&mdash;as
thorough going an old bachelor as any one need wish to see. Some
folks said he had a great many droll whims in his head. I don't
know how that was; but this I know, that he loved every body, and
almost every body loved him. He had evidently seen better days,
when, in my boyhood, I first made his acquaintance; or rather, he
had been "better off in the world," as the phrase goes. Whether he
had been happier, may admit of a question; for the wealthiest man
is not always the happiest. There were marks about him which seemed
to show that he had been higher on the wheel of fortune, and that
the change in his condition had had a chastening effect&mdash;just as
some fruits become mellower and better after being bruised a little
and frost-bitten. He was a great lover of children, and withal an
inveterate story-teller.</p>

<p align="justify">His memory must have been pretty good, I think;
for he would often tell stories to his little friends by the hour,
about what happened to him when he was a boy. Some of these stories
were funny enough; but the old gentleman usually managed to tack on
some good moral to the end of them. By your leave, boys and girls,
I will serve up two or three of these stories for an evening's
entertainment. They will bear telling the second time, I guess, and
I will repeat them, as nearly as my recollection will allow, in the
good old bachelor's own words.</p>

<hr width="10%">
<a name="094"></a>
<h3>STORY FIRST.</h3>

<h4>HONESTY THE BEST POLICY.</h4>

<p align="justify">A person is, on the whole, a great deal better
off to be honest. Dishonesty is a losing game. A wise man was once
asked what one gained by not telling the truth. The reply was, "Not
to be believed when he speaks the truth." He was right. There are a
great many other respects, too, in which a dishonest person suffers
by his dishonesty. I must tell you what a lie once cost me. I was
about nine years old, perhaps. In justice to myself, I ought to say
that I was not much addicted to this vice; but told a fib once in a
great while, as I am afraid too many other little boys, pretty good
on the whole, sometimes allow themselves to do. One very cool day
in the spring of the year, my father, who was a farmer, was
ploughing, and I was riding horse. I didn't relish the task very
well, as I was rather cold, and old Silvertail was full of his
mischief. It was a little more than I could do to manage him.
Moreover, there was some rare sport going on at home.</p>

<p align="justify">"Father," said I, after bearing the penance for
the greater part of the forenoon, "how much longer must I stay in
the field?"</p>

<p align="justify">"About an hour," was the reply.</p>

<p align="justify">An hour seemed a great while in the
circumstances, and I ventured to say, "I wish I could go home
now&mdash;my head aches."</p>

<p align="justify">"I am very sorry," said my father; "but can't
you stay till it is time to go home to dinner?"</p>

<p align="justify">I thought not&mdash;my headache was getting to be
pretty severe.</p>

<p align="justify">"Well," said he, taking me off the horse, and no
doubt suspecting that my disease was rather in my <i>heart</i> than
my head&mdash;a suspicion far too well-founded, I am sorry to
say&mdash;"well, you may go home. I don't want you to work if you are
sick. Go straight home, and tell your mother that I say you must
take a good large dose of rhubarb. Tell her that I think it will do
you a great deal of good!"</p>

<p align="justify">There was no alternative. I went home, of
course, and delivered the message to my mother. I told her,
however, that I thought my head was better, hoping to avoid taking
the nauseous medicine. But it was of no use. It was too late. She
understood my case as well as my father did. She knew well enough
my disease was laziness. So she prepared the rhubarb&mdash;an unusually
generous dose, I always thought&mdash;and I had to swallow every morsel
of it. Dear me! how bitter it was! It makes me sick to think of a
dose of rhubarb, let me be ever so well. I am sure I would have
rode horse all day&mdash;and all night, too, for that matter&mdash;rather
than to have been doctored after that sort. But it cured my
laziness pretty effectually, and it was a long time before I told
another lie, too.</p>

<p align="justify">"Honesty is the best policy," children, depend
upon it, though there is another and a better reason, as you very
well know, why you should always speak the truth.</p>

<a name="097"></a>
<h3>STORY SECOND.</h3>

<h4>HOW A ROGUE FEELS WHEN HE IS CAUGHT.</h4>

<p align="justify">When I was a little boy, as near as I can
recollect, about nine years of age, I went with my brother one
bright Saturday afternoon, when there was no school, to visit at
the house of Captain Perry. The captain was esteemed one of the
kindest and best-natured neighbors in Willow Lane, where my father
lived; and Julian, the captain's eldest son, very near my own age,
was, among all the boys at school, my favorite play-fellow. Captain
Perry had two bee-hives in his garden, where we were all three at
play; and as I watched the busy little fellows at work bringing in
honey from the fields, all at once I thought it would be a very
fine thing to thrust a stick into a hole which I saw in one of the
hives, and bring out some of the honey. My brother and Julian did
not quite agree with me in this matter. They thought, as nearly as
I can recollect, that there were three good reasons against this
mode of obtaining honey: first, I should be likely to get pretty
badly stung; secondly, the act would be a very mean and cowardly
piece of mischief; and, thirdly, I should be found out.</p>

<p align="justify">Still, I was bent on the chivalrous undertaking.
I procured a stick of the right size, and marched up to the hive to
make the attack. While I was deliberating, with the stick already a
little way in the hole, whether I had better thrust it in suddenly,
and then scamper away as fast as my legs could carry me, or proceed
so deliberately that the bees would not suspect what was the
matter, Captain Perry happened to come into the garden; and I was
so busy with my mischief, that I did not notice him until he
advanced within a rod or two of the bee-hives. He mistrusted what I
was about. "Roderick," said he. I looked around. I am sure I would
have given all I was worth in the world, not excepting my little
pony, which I regarded as a fortune, if, by some magic or other, I
could have got out of this scrape. But it was too late. I hung my
head down, as may be imagined, while the captain went on with his
speech: "Roderick, if I were in your place (I heartily wished he
was in my place, but I did not say so; I said nothing, in fact), if
I were in your place, I would not disturb those poor, harmless
bees, in that way. If you should put that stick into the hive, as
you were thinking of doing, it would take the bees a whole week to
mend up their cells. That is not the way we get honey. I don't
wonder you are fond of honey, though. Children generally are fond
of it; and if you will go into the house, Mrs Perry will give you
as much as you wish, I am sure."</p>

<p align="justify">This was twenty years ago&mdash;perhaps more. I have
met Captain Perry a hundred times since; yet even now I cannot look
upon his frank, honest countenance, but I distinctly call to mind
the Quixotic adventure with the bees, and I feel almost as much
ashamed as I did when I was detected.</p>

<h3>STORY THIRD.</h3>

<h4>THE WEEKLY NEWSPAPER.</h4>

<p align="justify">I never shall forget what a sensation it used to
produce in our family, years ago, when the newspaper came. We
children&mdash;there were three of us, one brother and two sisters&mdash;used
to watch for the post, on the all-important day, as anxiously as a
cat ever watched for a mouse. Peter Packer, the bearer of these
weekly dispatches, deserves a little notice. He was a queer man, at
least he had that reputation in our neighborhood. As long as I can
remember, he went his rounds; and, for aught I know, he is going to
this day.</p>

<p align="justify">Peter's old mare&mdash;she must be mentioned, for the
two are almost inseparable&mdash;was as odd as he was. I should think
she belonged to the same general class and order with Don Quixote's
renowned Rosinante; but she had one peculiarity which is not put
down in the description of Rosinante, to wit, the faculty of
diagonal or oblique locomotion. This mare of Peter's went forward
something after the manner of a crab, and a little like a ship with
the wind abeam, as the sailors say. It was a standing topic of
dispute among us boys, whether the animal went head foremost or
not. But that did not matter much, so that she made her
circuit&mdash;and she always did, punctually; that is, she always came
some time or another. Sometimes she was a day or two later than
usual; but this never occurred except in the summer season, and it
was in this wise: she had a most passionate love for the practical
study of botany; and not being allowed, when at home, to pursue her
favorite science as often as she wished, owing partly to a want of
specimens, and partly to her master's desire to educate her in the
more solid branches, she frequently took the liberty to divest
herself of her bridle, when standing at the door of her master's
customers, and to gallop away in search of flowers. She was a great
lover of botany, so much so, that, as I said before, her desire to
obtain specimens sometimes interfered a little with her other
literary engagements; and I am sure I can forgive her&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"For e'en her failings leaned to virtue's
side."</blockquote>

Just so it was with Peter himself. No storm, or tempest, or
snow-bank, could detain him&mdash;that is, not longer than a day or
two&mdash;in his weekly round. But he loved the theory of making money
as much as his mare loved botany; and he was a practical student,
too, and the road which he traveled afforded a good many
opportunities both for extending his knowledge of that science and
of practically applying his principles. So, between the two, our
newspaper sometimes got thoroughly aired before it came to the
house. But Peter was punctual&mdash;I insist upon it&mdash;for he always came
some time or another.
<p align="justify">When the paper did come, we literally devoured
its contents. With us it was an oracle. If the "Courier" affirmed
or denied a thing, that was enough for us. It was an end to all
debate. How confiding children are! He who has read "Robinson
Crusoe" when a boy, finds it almost impossible to regard it a fable
when he is a man. The newspaper, that makes its weekly visit to the
family circle in the country, leaves the marks of its influence
upon the mind and the morals of the child. It forms his tastes and

the selection of periodicals to be the companions of their
children.</p>

<h3>STORY FOURTH.</h3>

<h4>THE CIDER PLOT.</h4>

<p align="justify">When I was an apprentice, some years ago, I
lived&mdash;no matter where, and served&mdash;no matter whom. There were
three apprentices besides myself; and it seems necessary to say,
that, at the time when the incident happened which I am about to
relate, we had neither of us completed that branch of husbandry
called the sowing of wild oats; and as the soil was very favorable
for the development of that species of grain, we were perhaps a
little too industriously engaged in its cultivation. We were in
great haste to have the oats all sowed in good season.</p>

<p align="justify">One day our employer bought a cast of
cider&mdash;Newark cider, I believe they called it&mdash;and the greater
portion of it was nicely bottled, and placed in a dark corner of
the cellar, to be used, not for making vinegar, or mince pies, but
for a very different purpose&mdash;which may be surmised by such as
remember that in those days the juice of the apple had a much
better reputation than it has now. We were allowed our share of the
beverage. But we were not satisfied. We resolved ourselves into a
sort of committee of the whole, one afternoon; and after a long and
somewhat spirited debate, came to the unanimous conclusion that, in
the course of human events, it became necessary to employ the most
effective measures to procure additional supplies from the cellar.
Now it so happened, that these measures were not of the most
peaceable and honorable kind. Such was their nature, in fact, that
if we had been discovered in the act of resorting to them, it would
no doubt have been deemed necessary, in the general course of human
events, that we should be soundly whipped.</p>

<p align="justify">The plan was to seize a bottle once in a while,
something after the manner of privateers; though I believe the
trade of privateering is regarded as piracy, now-a-days. How times
are changed! We were to go on this expedition in rotation, from the
oldest downward. We commenced, and two of us had performed the
feat. It came George Reese's turn next. You didn't know George, I
suppose. But I wish you had known him. I think you could appreciate
the story better, if you knew him as well as I did. Well, George
went down cellar, with his pitcher in his hand, thirsting for cider
and glory. You must know that there was a flight of stairs that led
directly to the cellar from the room we occupied. You should know,
too, that we went down without a light, and felt our way in the
dark. George had not been below two minutes, when we heard a report
from the cellar very like the discharge of a pistol. It was loud
enough to alarm the whole house. We were frightened. We had reason
to be. Who knows, thought we, but they have set a spring-gun for
us, and poor George is badly wounded? We waited in silence, and
with not a little anxiety, for our hero to come up.</p>

<p align="justify">He came at last, and a sorry looking fellow he
was. He was covered from head to foot with yeast! The cook had
placed her bottle of emptyings, tightly corked, in the village of
cider bottles; and the truth flashed upon us at once, that George
had made a mistake, and captured the wrong bottle; and the most of
its contents, being a little angry at the time, were discharged
into his face. But this was not all. George thought he had
encountered a cider bottle, after all, for he could see nothing in
the cellar, and he had poured what little remained of his yeast
into the pitcher, and brought it up with him. When he made his
appearance, there was such a noisy trio of laughter as that old
kitchen had seldom heard before. This brought in the cook, and she
laughed as loudly as the rest of us. Then, to crown all, the lady
of the house, hearing the noise, came to see what we were all
about; and she laughed the loudest of any body. I shall never
forget the image of George Reese, as he entered that room. It gives
me a pain in the side now, only to think of it.</p>

<p align="justify">MORAL 1.&mdash;Before undertaking any enterprise
similar to this cider-plot, it is desirable to count the cost.</p>

<p align="justify">MORAL 2.&mdash;In your pursuit after glory, take care
that you do not come in contact with something else that is not so
pleasant.</p>

<h3>STORY FIFTH.</h3>

<h4>MY FIRST HUNTING-EXCURSION.</h4>

<p align="justify">I shall never forget the first time I sallied
out into the woods to try my hand at hunting. Carlo, the old family
dog, went with me, and he was about as green in the matter of
securing game as myself. We were pretty well matched, I think. I
played the part of Hudibras, as nearly as I can recollect, and
Carlo was a second Ralph. I had a most excellent fowling-piece&mdash;so
they said. It began its career in the French war, and was a very
veteran in service. Besides this ancient and honorable weapon, I
was provided with all the means and appliances necessary for
successful hunting. I was "armed and equipped as the law directs,"
to employ the words of those semi-annual documents that used to
summon me to training.</p>

<p align="justify">Well, it was sometime before we&mdash;Carlo and
I&mdash;started any game. Wind-mills were scarce. For one, I began to
fear we should have to return without any adventure to call forth
our skill and courage. But the brightest time is often just before
day, and so it was in this instance. Carlo began presently to bark,
and I heard a slight rustling among the leaves in the woods. Sure
enough, there was visible a large animal of some kind, though I
could not determine precisely what it was, on account of the
underbrush. However, I satisfied myself that it was rare game, at
any rate; and that point being settled, I took aim and fired.</p>

<p align="justify">Carlo immediately ran to the poor victim. He was
a courageous fellow, that Carlo, especially after the danger was
over. Many a time I have known him make demonstrations as fierce as
a tiger when people rode by our house, though he generally took
care not to insult them until they were at a convenient distance.
Carlo had no notion of being killed, knowing very well that if he
were dead, he could be of no service whatever to the world.
Hudibras said well when he said,</p>

<blockquote>"That he who fights and runs away,<br>
 May live to fight another day."</blockquote>

"images/thumb/0108.jpg" border="0" alt=
"RODERICK'S FIRST SHOT."></a><br>RODERICK'S FIRST SHOT.</p>

<p align="justify">That was good logic. But Carlo went farther than
this, even. He was for running away before he fought at all; and so
he always did, except when the enemy ran away first, in which case
he ran after him, as every chivalrous dog should. In the case of
the animal which I shot at, Carlo bounded to his side when the gun
was discharged, as I said before. For myself, I did not venture
quite so soon, remembering that caution is the parent of safety. By
and by, however, I mustered courage, and advanced to the spot.
There lay the victim of my first shot! It was one of my father's
sheep! Poor creature! She was sick, I believe, and went into a
thicket, near a stream of water, where she could die in peace.</p>

<p align="justify">I don't know whether I hit her or not. I didn't
look to see, but ran home as fast as my legs would carry me. Thus
ended the first hunting excursion in which I ever engaged, and,
though I was a mere boy then, and am somewhat advanced now, it
proved to be my last.</p>

<h2>SATURDAY IN WINTER.</h2>

<p>I.</p>

<p>Our tasks are all done, come away! come away!<br>
For a right merry time&mdash;for a Saturday play.<br>
See! the bright sun is shining right bravely on high;<br>
Make haste, or he'll soon be half over the sky.<br>
Come! first with our sleds down the glassy hill side,<br>
And then on our skates o'er the river we'll glide.</p>

<p>II.</p>

<p>Now, Harry! sit firm on your sled&mdash;here we go!<br>
Swift&mdash;swift as an arrow let fly from a bow!<br>
Hurrah! downward rushing, how gayly we speed,<br>
Like an Arab away on his fleet-going steed.<br>
Hurrah! bravely done! Down the icy hill side,<br>
Swift&mdash;swift as an arrow, again let us glide.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p>And now for the river! How smooth and how bright,<br>
Like a mirror it sleeps in the flashing sunlight.<br>
Be sure, brother Harry, to strap your skates well;<br>
Last time you remember how heavy you fell.<br>
Now away! swift away! why, Harry! not down?<br>
Are you hurt? You must take better care of your<br>
crown.</p>

<p>IV.</p>

<p>Up, up, my good brother! now steady! start fair!<br>
Away we go! swift through the keen, frosty air.<br>
Down again! Bless me, Harry! your skates can't be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right&mdash;<br>
Just wait till I see&mdash;no&mdash;but now they are tight.<br>
Here we go again! merry as school-boys can be,<br>
From books, pens, and pencils, and black board, set free.</p>

<p>V.</p>

<p>Tired, at last, of our sport, home to dinner we run,<br>
And find that, two hours ago, dinner was done.<br>
But our meat and potatoes we relish quite well,<br>
Though cold&mdash;and the reason we scarcely need tell.<br>
Five hours spent in scudding and skating, I ween,<br>
'Twould give to such lads as we, appetites keen.</p>

<p>VI.</p>

<p>At last the dim twilight succeeds to the day;<br>
Our week's work is ended, and ended our play.<br>
'Tis Saturday night, and we know with the morn,<br>
Another dear Sabbath of rest will be born.<br>
O'er wearied, we sink into slumber profound,<br>
Assured that God's angels are watching around.</p>

"ROVER AND HIS LITTLE MASTER."></a><br>ROVER AND HIS LITTLE MASTER.</p>

<h2>ROVER AND HIS LITTLE MASTER.</h2>

<p align="justify">"Come, Rover!" said Harry, as he passed a fine
old Newfoundland dog that lay on a mat at the door; "come, Rover! I
am going down to the river to sail my boat, and I want you to go
with me."</p>

<p align="justify">Rover opened his large eyes, and looked lazily
at his little master.</p>

<p align="justify">"Come! Rover! Rover!"</p>

<p align="justify">But the dog didn't care to move, and so Harry
went off to the river side alone. He had not been gone a great
while, before a thought of her boy came suddenly into the mother's
mind. Remembering that he had a little vessel, and that the river
was near, it occurred to her that he might have gone there.</p>

<p align="justify">Instantly her heart began to throb with
alarm.</p>

<p align="justify">"Is Harry with you?" she called up to Harry's
father, who was in his study. But Harry's father said he was not
there.</p>

<p align="justify">"I'm afraid he's gone to the river with his
boat," said the mother.</p>

<p align="justify">"To the river!" And Mr Lee dropped his pen, and
came quickly down. Taking up his hat, he went hurriedly from the
house. Rover was still lying upon the mat, with his head upon his
paws and his eyes shut.</p>

<p align="justify">"Rover!" said his master, in a quick, excited
voice, "where is Harry? Has he gone to the river? Away and see!
quick!"</p>

<p align="justify">The dog must have understood every word, for he
sprang eagerly to his feet, and rushed toward the river. Mr Lee
followed as fast as he could run. When he reached the river bank,
he saw his little boy in the water, with Rover dragging him toward
the shore. He was just in time to receive the half-drowned child in
his arms, and carry him home to his mother.</p>

<p align="justify">Harry, who remained insensible, was placed in a
warm bed. He soon, however, revived, and in an hour or two was
running about again. But after this, Rover would never leave the
side of his little master, when he wandered beyond the garden gate.
Wherever you found Harry, there Rover was sure to be&mdash;sometimes
walking by his side, and sometimes lying on the grass, with his big
eyes watching every movement.</p>

<p align="justify">Once Harry found his little vessel, which had
been hidden away since he went with it to the river, and, without
his mother's seeing him, he started again for the water. Rover, as
usual, was with him. On his way to the river, he saw some flowers,
and, in order to gather them, put his boat down upon the grass.
Instantly Rover picked it up in his mouth, and walked back toward
the house with it. After going a little way, he stopped, looked
around, and waited until Harry had got his hand full of flowers.
The child then saw that Rover had his boat, and tried to get it
from him; but Rover played around him, always keeping out of his
reach, and retreating toward the house, until he got back within
the gate. Then he bounded into the house, and laid the boat at the
feet of Harry's mother.</p>

<p align="justify">Harry was a little angry with the good old dog,
at first, but when his mother explained to him what Rover meant, he
hugged him around the neck, and said he would never go down to the
river again any more.</p>

<p align="justify">Harry is a man now, and Rover has long since
been dead; but he often thinks of the dear old dog that saved him
from drowning when he was a child; and it gives him great pleasure
to remember that he never beat Rover, as some boys beat their dogs,
when they are angry, and was never unkind to him. Had it been
otherwise, the thought would have given him great pain.</p>

"SOMETHING WRONG."></a><br>SOMETHING WRONG.</p>

<h2>SOMETHING WRONG.</h2>

<p align="justify">What's the matter here? There is something
wrong. It is clear that the little boy in the picture is not
receiving kind treatment at the hands of his sister. But what is
she doing to him? Not pulling his ear, we hope. Something is wrong;
what can it be? We must try and make it out. There is a whip and a
top on the floor, and also a chair thrown down, to which a string
is tied.</p>

<p align="justify">The little boy, we suppose, was whipping his
top, while his sister was playing with the chair.</p>

<p align="justify">"Take care, now, Johnny," says the sister, as
the lash of her brother's whip comes every little while close to
her face; "take care, or you will cut me in the eyes."</p>

<p align="justify">But Johnny either doesn't hear, or doesn't heed,
and keeps on whipping his top.</p>

<p align="justify">"There, now!" says Anna, "you came as near as
could be to striking me. I wish you would go out into the passage
or down into the dining-room with your top."</p>

<p align="justify">"John," says mamma, looking up from her work,
"you must be careful and not cut your sister with that whip."</p>

<p align="justify">"No, ma'am," replies Johnny, and keeps on with
his sport as carelessly as ever.</p>

<p align="justify">Presently there is a cry, and then an angry
exclamation. The lash of Johnny's whip has fallen with a smarting
stroke on Anna's neck. The little girl, without waiting to reflect,
follows the impulse of her feelings, and seeks to punish her
brother by pinching and pulling his ears.</p>

<p align="justify">This is the story of the picture, and we are
sorry it will not bear a more favorable explanation.</p>

<p align="justify">We do not think that any of our young readers
will approve the conduct of either of the children. Undoubtedly,
Johnny was wrong not to have been more careful how he threw his
lash about. Anna had as much right to be in the room as he had, and
if Johnny wanted to whip his top, it was his place to do it so
cautiously as not in the least to endanger his sister's face and
eyes; and he deserved to have his top taken from him as a
punishment for his carelessness and indifference; and no doubt this
was done by his mother.</p>

<p align="justify">And Anna was wrong, likewise, for permitting her
angry feelings to so carry her away as to lead her to hurt her
brother, in revenge for what he had done to her. So, you see,
Johnny's wrong act was the cause of a still greater departure from
right in his sister. If Johnny had loved his sister, he would have
been much more careful how he used his whip; and if Anna had loved
her brother, she would never have been tempted to strike him or
pull his ear, even if he had hurt her.</p>

<p align="justify">It is a very sad thing for little brothers and
sisters to quarrel with each other.</p>

<blockquote>"Birds in their little nests agree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'tis a shameful sight,<br>
When children of one family,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall out, and chide, and fight."</blockquote>

<p align="justify">We hope, among all our little readers, there is
not a brother and sister who have quarreled&mdash;who have ever called
each other hard names&mdash;or, worse, who have ever lifted their tiny
hands to hurt each other.</p>

"THE FAVORITE CHILD."></a><br>THE FAVORITE CHILD.</p>

<h2>THE FAVORITE CHILD.</h2>

<p align="justify">In a very pretty little village not many miles
from N&mdash;&mdash;, in Connecticut, lived Susan Meredith. She was the
youngest of three sisters, the eldest of whom could not be more
than twelve or thirteen years of age. A year or two before the
period when our history of this little group commences, the mother
had gone to her rest.</p>

<p align="justify">Weighed down with a sorrow too heavy to be
borne, and of a nature too delicate to be confided to others, she
sank under it while in the noon of life, and died commending her
children to God. Susan&mdash;little Sue, as she was frequently
called&mdash;young as she was, remembered a thousand incidents connected
with the departed one, and seemed, so late as the time at which our
story begins, to be never happier than when her mother was the
theme of conversation.</p>

<p align="justify">There was something remarkable in this. One
reason for it might have been, that the surviving parent of these
sisters, though once a kind and affectionate father, was now so
altered by habits of intemperance, that they found very little
enjoyment in his society. But there was another reason. Little Sue
was an unusually thoughtful, serious child, for one of her years.
Was there not another reason, still? I do not know. I cannot tell
what words God may whisper to the child that loves him; but this I
know, that little Sue talked much of heaven, and seemed to have
learned more of the language of heaven than men can teach.</p>

<p align="justify">One bright Saturday, in the early spring time,
when there was no school, these sisters might have been seen
winding their way through the woods, not far from the house where
they lived, searching for the first wild flowers. Little Sue, the
youngest, was very happy, but, as usual, more grave than the other
sisters. By and by, wearied with their walk, they sat down under
the shadow, of a tree, and talked a great while. At first, the
conversation was about birds and flowers; but Sue soon gave a
serious turn to it.</p>

<p align="justify">"I wonder," said she, "if dear mother has pretty
flowers in heaven. I hope so&mdash;she loved them so well. Do you
remember the little monthly rose she wanted we should bring into
her room, just before she died? How happy she was, when one of us
went and brought it to her bed. And she went to heaven so soon
after that! Oh, I think there must be flowers up there in the sky,
or she would not have thought of them and loved them so, when she
was dying. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p align="justify">And she was silent. So were her sisters, awhile.
Thoughts of heaven made them serious. They were sad, too. When the
youngest&mdash;their darling Sue&mdash;conversed in this strain, a cloud
always came over their sunny faces. They could scarcely tell why it
was so; for they, too, loved to think of heaven. But the language
of their sister seemed to them to belong to another world; and
often, in the midst of their brightest hopes, would come the fear,
like a thunderbolt, that God would crush that cherished flower, and
remove her from their embrace while she was young.</p>

<p align="justify">"Sue," at length said Eliza, the eldest sister,
"why do you always talk so much about heaven?"</p>

<p align="justify">"I don't know," was the reply; "perhaps, because
I think a good deal about it. I dreamed last night"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, I thought so," said Maria, playfully
interrupting her sister; "I should think the little fairies were
playing hide and seek all around your pillow every night. I wish
they would whisper in my ears as they do in yours. Why, the naughty
things hardly ever speak to me, and when they do, they tell a very
different story from those they tell you. It is generally about
falling down from a church steeple, or something of that kind.
Well, what did they say to you this time, dear?"</p>

<p align="justify">"I never had such a dream before," said the
favorite, her face glowing with a new, almost an unearthly
radiance; "I mean I never had one just like it. When dear mother
died, you remember I told you a dream about the angels. Last night
I thought they came to me again, and I saw mother, too, so
clearly!"</p>

<p align="justify">She stopped, and her eyes fell. She seemed
almost sorry that she had said as much; for she had not forgotten
that the former dream to which she alluded had caused her sisters
pain, and she thought, that perhaps she should make them unhappy
again, if she related her dream of the night before. But her
sisters begged her to go on, and she did so.</p>

<p align="justify">"When I went to sleep," said she, "I was
thinking of&mdash;of&mdash;what father had said to me"&mdash;and she burst into a
flood of tears. Her sisters wept, too; for they well remembered
that their father had come home intoxicated that night, and that he
had spoken very harshly to them all, and especially to the
youngest. They could not say much to console her. What could they
say? Silently they wept, and by their tears and embraces they told
her how deeply they sympathized with her, and how much they would
do for her, if they could. When the little dreamer was able to go
on, she said,</p>

<p align="justify">"I was thinking about this when I went to sleep.
I thought I was crying, and wondering why God should let dear
mother die, and leave us all alone, when I heard some one say,
'Look up,' I looked up in the sky, and all the stars were windows,
and I saw through them. I saw heaven&mdash;so beautiful&mdash;so beautiful! I
saw mother looking out of one of these windows, and she smiled, as
she did when we brought the rose to her bed-side. I heard her call
my name, and she reached her arms toward me, and said, 'You may
come,' Oh, this was not like other dreams"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"Don't think of it, dear sister; don't think of
it any more," said Eliza. "You was not well last night, and I have
often heard, that when people are ill, their dreams are more apt to
be disturbed. But we will not say any more about it now, dear."</p>

<p align="justify">"No," said Maria; "we shall all feel too sad, if
we do." And she made an effort to be cheerful; though tears stood
in her eyes as she spoke.</p>

<p align="justify">"I don't know why it makes others feel sad to
think of heaven," said the favorite. "I should love dearly to go
there."</p>

<p align="justify">"But then it is so dreadful to die!"</p>

<p align="justify">"I know it; but mother was so happy when she
died!"</p>

<p align="justify">"Would you be willing to leave your sisters,
dear Sue?"</p>

<p align="justify">"No; not unless I could see my mother and
Christ. Oh, I do love Christ more than all the rest of my friends!
Do you think that is wrong?"</p>

<p align="justify">The three sisters slowly and thoughtfully bent
their steps homeward, and just as the sun was setting, and the
western clouds were spread with the beauty and glory of twilight,
they entered that cottage which, though the abode of sorrow, was
yet dear and sacred to them, because it was once the home of their
mother.</p>

<p align="justify">From that time, the gentle, loving, thoughtful
little Sue, faded&mdash;faded as a flower in the autumn wind. She had
not been well for weeks; and soon it was evident that she was
rapidly declining. Was her dream a cause or an effect&mdash;a cause of
her decline, or an effect of an illness already preying upon her
frail system? Perhaps we cannot tell. There is something very
remarkable about many dreams. It is not easy to account for them
all, by what is known of the laws of the mind. But we must not stop
now to inquire into this matter.</p>

<p align="justify">Step by step, that cherished sister went
downward to the grave; and before the summer had come, while the
early violet and the pure anemone were still in bloom, God called
her home. Peacefully and beautifully her sun went down. "They have
come," she said. So died the youngest&mdash;the favorite child.</p>

"images/thumb/0128.jpg" border="0" alt="THE MINE."></a><br>THE MINE.</p>

<h2>THE MINE.</h2>

<p align="justify">There are three kingdoms in nature&mdash;the Mineral
kingdom, the Vegetable kingdom, and the Animal kingdom&mdash;the former
for the sake of the latter, and all for the sake of man. Without
the Vegetable kingdom animals could not exist, and without the
Mineral kingdom vegetables could not exist.</p>

<p align="justify">It is also worthy of remark, that in all the
inferior kingdoms of nature, there is an image of what is superior.
The lowest of all the kingdoms is the Mineral kingdom, where every
thing takes a fixed form, and where all changes are the work of
centuries, instead of days and months, as in the Vegetable and
Animal kingdoms. Yet, in this dull, inert kingdom, we find a
certain image of the one next above, in the upright or orderly
forms into which many of its substances arrange themselves. Under
circumstances of more than usual freedom, particles of matter in
this kingdom will assume shapes so nearly resembling those of the
Vegetable kingdom, that many were at first disposed to conclude
that they were mere petrifactions; as in the case of formations at
the bottom of the ocean, and those that take place in caverns. But
we will not wonder at this, when we remember, that the use of the
Mineral kingdom is to sustain the Vegetable kingdom, in order that
the latter may sustain the Animal kingdom. Use, it must be
remembered, is the great law that pervades, sustains, and holds in
harmonious order, the whole universe.</p>

<p align="justify">In the Vegetable kingdom we see a still nearer
approach to man. There is motion and life&mdash;not conscious life, but
a kind of insensible existence. Nearly all the members of this
kingdom elevate themselves toward heaven, and stand upright, like
men.</p>

<p align="justify">In the Animal kingdom there is still greater
perfection of life and freedom. Beasts move over the earth, birds
fly through the air, and fishes change their places, at will, in
the sea. This is the highest and most perfect kingdom, and it is
for the sake of this that the others exist. And, as was just said,
all three are for the sake of man. They go to sustain his natural
life, while he remains in this world.</p>

<p align="justify">The variety and beauty in the two higher
kingdoms are displayed to the eyes of all. But the wonders of the
Mineral kingdom are hidden beneath the surface. Mines have to be
opened, in order to obtain the metals and precious stones that the
earth hides in her bosom; and man can only obtain them through hard
and patient labor. Hundreds of feet below the surface of the
ground, the miner, with no light to direct his labor but that given
him by his dimly burning safety-lamp, toils on, unconscious of the
day's opening or decline. The sun does not rise nor set for him. He
is not warned by the home-returning bee, the dimly falling shadows
of evening, nor the sudden cry of the night-bird, that the hour of
rest has come. But the body cannot endure labor beyond a certain
number of hours. Tired nature calls for repose, and the call must
be obeyed. Even the miner must have his hours of rest; and then he
comes forth, it may be, from his gloomy place of labor, once more
into the sunlight; or sinks to sleep in the dark chambers where he
toils for bread.</p>

<p align="justify">When you look at a piece of metal, whether it be
gold, silver, copper, or iron, remember that it has been won from
its hidden place, deep in the solid earth, by the hard labor of
man.</p>

<h3>THE MINER.</h3>

<p>Down where the daylight never comes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Toileth the miner on;<br>
He sees not the golden morning break&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He sees not the setting sun.<br>
<br>
Dimly his lamp in the dark vault burns,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he sits on the miner's hard floor,<br>
Toiling, toiling, toiling on;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Toiling for precious ore!<br>
<br>
The air is wet; for the dew and rain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drank by the thirsty ground,<br>
Have won their way to his dark retreat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And are trickling all around&mdash;-<br>
<br>
And sickly vapors are near his lips,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And close to his wire-net lamp,<br>
Unseen, as an evil spirit comes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Up stealeth the dread fire-damp!<br>
<br>
But the miner works on, though death is by,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fears not the monster grim;<br>
For the wiry gauze, round his steady light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes a safety-lamp for him.<br>
<br>
Rough and rude, and of little worth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems the ore that the miner brings<br>
From the hidden places where lie concealed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth's rare and precious things;<br>
<br>
But, tried awhile in the glowing fire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rough and rude no more;<br>
Art moulds the iron, and forms the gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fashions the silver ore.<br>
<br>
And useful, rare, and beautiful things,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Neath the hand of skill arise:<br>
Oh! a thousand thousand human wants<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The miner's toil supplies!</p>

<h2>VISIT TO FAIRY LAND.</h2>

<p align="justify">So, then, you want to hear some stories about
the fairies, do you, little girl? Well, I must humor you a little,
I suppose; though I should not wonder if my fairy stories were
somewhat different from those you have heard before. But have you
the least idea that there were ever such beings as the fairies in
the world? If you have, let me tell you, you are quite mistaken.
The stories that have been told about these fairy people are none
of them worthy of belief, though it must be admitted that millions
have believed them. Many of the men and women who pretended to have
seen the fairies, and who related the stories in the first place,
believed all they said, I have no doubt. But they were generally
ignorant persons, very superstitious, and easily imposed upon.
There are, it is true, invisible inhabitants in this world. Those
who believe the Bible, can hardly doubt the presence of angels
among us. But angels, as they are represented in the Scriptures,
are a very different class of spirits from those called fairies, if
we may credit what has been said of this singular race of beings,
by those who pretend to have seen them in fairy land.</p>

<p align="justify">Not a great while ago, the people of England and
Scotland were very superstitious. It is not two centuries since our
good forefathers on that island were burning witches by scores. At
that time, a great many believed in the existence of fairies, or
elves. I have been at some pains to find out at what time this
fairy superstition first appeared among the Britons. But it seems
not very easy to determine. One thing is certain, that the belief
in some kind of spirits&mdash;either the same with the fairies, under a
different name, or very nearly related to them&mdash;dates back to a
very early period in British history&mdash;earlier, probably, than the
Christian era.</p>

<p align="justify">The fairies are always represented as very small
and very beautiful&mdash;generally, as perfect miniatures of the human
form. The color of their dress is uniformly pure green. It would
seem, according to the accounts of these people, some five or six
hundred years ago, that they were kind, amiable, excellent
neighbors. Indeed, one of the names they went by was, "the Good
Neighbors," and another was, "the Men of Peace." Still, they used
to do some mischief in those days, if we may believe their
historians, who tell us that the fairies, once in a while, visited
the abodes of men, and carried away captives into their invisible
haunts, under ground. The reason for this kidnapping of human
beings was said to be, that the fairies were obliged occasionally
to pay a tribute of this kind to their king or queen.</p>

<p align="justify">The fairies were not always cunning enough to
keep their victims, after they had caught them. Sometimes people
would come back from fairy land, and tell all about what they had
seen there. You might suppose that a great deal would be learned of
these strange, invisible creatures, from the men and women who had
been with them and escaped. Well, so there was. But the worst of it
was, the stories did not hang together very well; and there were
about as many different and contradictory accounts of fairydom as
there were different individuals who pretended to have made a visit
to that country. However, all seemed to agree that fairy land was a
very merry country. The people there were great lovers of fun,
according to the general testimony, and used to dance a great deal
by moonlight, in the open air. They are engaged in one of their
dances, you see, in the engraving. Every evening, as soon as the
moon rose, they assembled at some convenient place, took hold of
each other's hands, usually in a ring, I think, and then they had a
right merry time of it, you may depend. It did not seem to make any
difference, whether the spot selected for the dance was on the land
or on the sea. Indeed, they could dance pretty well in the air,
without any thing to stand upon. The assemblies held in the palaces
of the king and queen of the fairies, were, at times, splendid in
the extreme. No poet, in his most lofty flights of fancy, ever
dreamed of such beauty and splendor as were exhibited at the fairy
court. They rode on milk-white steeds. Their dresses were of
brilliant green, and were rich beyond conception. When they mingled
in the dance, or moved in procession among the shady groves, or
over the delightful meadows, covered with the fairest of flowers,
music, such as mortal lips cannot utter, floated on the breeze.</p>

<p align="justify">However, these splendors, astonishing as they
were, all vanished in a moment, whenever the eye of any one gifted
with the power of spiritual communion was turned upon them. Then
their treasures of gold and silver became slate-stones, and their
stately halls were turned into damp caverns. They themselves,
instead of being the beautiful creatures they were before, became
ugly as a hedge-fence.</p>

<p align="justify">The king of fairy land was called
<i>Oberon</i>&mdash;the queen, <i>Titania</i>. The king used to wear a
crown of jewels on his head, and he always carried a horn in his
hand, which set every body around him to dancing, whenever he blew
it. Ben Jonson, a poet who flourished a great many years ago,
speaks very respectfully of fairies and elves, in his poems. In
describing the haunts of his "Sad Shepherd," he says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"There, in the stocks of trees, white fays do
dwell,<br>
And span-long elves that dance about a pool."</blockquote>

<p align="justify">Shakspeare, too, in several of his plays, makes
us quite familiar with the fairy people. Shakspeare, you are aware,
wrote in the time of Elizabeth, and as late as that period, there
were thousands in England and Scotland in whose creed the existence
of such a race of spirits was a very important article. It was not
long, however, after this, before the superstition about the
fairies&mdash;which, at the worst, was a very foolish affair&mdash;began to
decline. But that decline brought a dark night to thousands of
poor, innocent men and women; for then came the era of witchcraft,
and persons of every rank, convicted of this imaginary crime, were
hurried to the scaffold or the stake.</p>

<p align="justify">In the beginning of the seventeenth century, Dr.
Corbett, Bishop of Oxford and Norwich, wrote a very humorous satire
on the fairy superstition, called "The Fairies' Farewell, a proper
new ballad to be sung or whistled to the tune of Meadow Brow."
Perhaps I cannot better take leave of these very curious imaginary
people, than to employ a couple of stanzas from the bishop's
playful ballad:</p>

<blockquote>"Witness those rings and roundelays<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of theirs, which yet remain,<br>
&nbsp;Were footed in Queen Mary's days,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On many a grassy plain;<br>
&nbsp;But since of late Elizabeth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And later James came in,<br>
&nbsp;They never danced on any heath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the time hath been.<br>
<br>
"By which we note the fairies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were of the old profession;<br>
&nbsp;Their songs were Ave Marias,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their dances were processions;<br>
&nbsp;But now, alas! they all are dead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or gone beyond the seas,<br>
&nbsp;Or further for religion fled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else they take their ease."</blockquote>

<h2>THE HERMIT.</h2>

<p align="justify"><a href="images/0144.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0144.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt=
"Ornamented 'A'"></a> Traveler was once passing through a great
wilderness, in which he supposed no human being dwelt. But, while
riding along in its gloomiest part, he was surprised to see a
hermit, his face covered with a long beard, that hung down upon his
breast, sitting on a stone at the entrance of what seemed a
cave.</p>

<p align="justify">The hermit arose as the traveler drew up his
horse, and speaking kindly to him, invited him to accept such
refreshment as it was in his power to offer. The traveler did not
refuse, but, dismounting, tied his horse to a tree, and, following
the pious man, entered the narrow door of a little cave which
nature had formed in the side of a mountain. All the hermit had to
set before the traveler, was water from a pure stream that came
merrily leaping down the hill side, and some wild fruit and
nuts.</p>

<p align="justify">"Tell me," said the traveler, after he had
eaten, "why a man with a sound body, such as you possess, and a
sound mind, should hide away from his fellow-men, in a dreary wild
like this?"</p>

<p align="justify">"For pious meditation and repentance," replied
the hermit. "All is vanity in the world. Its beauties charm but to
allure from heaven. And worse than this, it is full of evil. Turn
where you will, pain, sorrow, and crime meet your eyes. But here,
in the silence of nature, there is nothing to draw the mind from
holy thoughts; there is no danger of falling into temptation. By
pious meditation and prayer, we are purified and made fit for
heaven."</p>

<p align="justify">"Not so," answered the traveler; "pious
meditation and prayer are of no avail without good be done to our
fellow-men. Piety is nothing without charity; and charity consists
in willing well and doing well to our neighbors. 'And now abideth
faith, hope, and charity,' says the Apostle, 'but the greatest of
these is charity,' Hermit, you are not wise thus to retire from the
midst of the busy world. Your service cannot be acceptable to God.
Go back again among your fellow-men, and faithfully perform your
real duties in life. Heal the sick, comfort the mourner, bind up
the broken heart, and in the various walks of life do good to
friend and enemy. Without this, how can you hope in the judgment to
hear the Lord say, 'As much as ye have done it unto the least of
these, ye have done it unto me?'"</p>

<p align="justify">The hermit, at such unexpected words, bowed his
head, and was silent. The traveler went on, and said&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"You have committed a common error, in supposing
that in holy meditation, as it is called, there was any thing
particularly pleasing to God. But reason will tell you why the
widow's mite is more acceptable in heaven than the most pious
thoughts of idle self-righteousness. Hermit! go back again into the
world, and there act your part as a man in the great social body.
Only by this means will you be prepared to live and act in the
great body of angels in heaven."</p>

<p align="justify">The hermit could not reply, but still sat with
his head bowed to his bosom, and his eyes upon the ground. The
words of the stranger fell with strokes of reproof upon his
heart.</p>

<p align="justify">When the traveler returned that way, he sought
for the hermit, but found him not at the door of his cave. He
entered, but the place had been a long time deserted. The erring
man had gone back into the world, and taken his place among his
fellows. And he had done right. No man is wise who retires from
society, and shuts himself up in the hope of becoming better
through prayer and pious thoughts. Only by doing our duty to our
fellow-men, in some particular pursuit in life, can we hope to grow
better and wiser?</p>

"A PICTURE."></a><br>A PICTURE.</p>

<h2>A PICTURE.</h2>

<p align="justify">What have we here? That kind-looking old
gentleman must have something for these children; his hand is in
his pocket, and they are all gathering around him. I wonder who he
is, and what he is going to give them?</p>

<p align="justify">"He's their uncle, may be."</p>

<p align="justify">"Or their grandfather."</p>

<p align="justify">"Or somebody else that is kind to children."</p>

<p align="justify">No doubt of it in the world. He is some one who
likes children, you may be sure. And I suppose he's got a pocket
full of sugar-plums or nuts for his favorites. The little girl who
has seized his cane, I rather think, will get the largest share;
but I don't suppose her young companions will be at all displeased
at this, for no doubt she is a very good girl, and beloved by all.
Indeed, if we may judge by the faces of the children, not one of
them will look at what the other receives, to see if he has not
obtained the largest share.</p>

<p align="justify">This is not always so, however. I know some
little boys and girls, who, when their parents, relatives, or
friends give them cakes, candies, or playthings, immediately look
from what they have themselves to what the others have received,
and, if one thinks his share smaller or inferior, becomes
dissatisfied, and, from a jealous and envious spirit, sacrifices
his own pleasure and that of all the rest. Because there is a
square inch more of cake in his brother's piece, that which he has
doesn't taste good. If he have one sugar-plum less than the others,
they become tasteless, and he throws them all, perhaps, upon the
floor.</p>

<p align="justify">How bad all this looks, and how very bad it
really is! The friends of such children are never encouraged to
make them presents. They rather avoid doing so; for they know that
their greedy, envious, covetous spirit, will turn the good things
they would offer them into causes of strife and unhappiness.</p>

<p>So now, pretty robin, you've come to my door;<br>
I wonder you never have ventured before:<br>
'Tis likely you thought I would do you some harm;<br>
But pray, sir, what cause have you seen for alarm?</p>

<p>II.</p>

<p>You seem to be timid&mdash;I'd like to know why&mdash;<br>
Did I ever hurt you? What makes you so shy?<br>
You shrewd little rogue, I've a mind, ere you go,<br>
To tell you a thing it concerns you to know.</p>

<p>III</p>

<p>You think I have never discovered your nest;<br>
'Tis hid pretty snugly, it must be confessed.<br>
Ha! ha! how the boughs are entwined all around!<br>
No wonder you thought it would never be found.</p>

<p>IV.</p>

<p>You're as cunning a robin as ever I knew;<br>
And yet, ha! ha! ha! I'm as cunning as you!<br>
I know all about your nice home on the tree&mdash;'Twas<br>
nonsense to try to conceal it from me.</p>

<p>V.</p>

<p>I know&mdash;for but yesterday I was your guest&mdash;<br>
How many young robins there are in your nest;<br>
And pardon me, sir, if I venture to say,<br>
They've had not a morsel of dinner to-day.</p>

<p>VI.</p>

<p>But you look very sad, pretty robin, I see,<br>
As you glance o'er the meadow, to yonder green tree;<br>
I fear I have thoughtlessly given you pain,<br>
And I will not prattle so lightly again.</p>

<p>VII.</p>

<p>Go home, where your mate and your little ones dwell;<br>
Though I know where they are, yet I never will tell;<br>
Nobody shall injure that leaf-covered nest,<br>
For sacred to me is the place of your rest.</p>

<h2>SOMETHING ABOUT CONSCIENCE:</h2>

<h3>OR MR MASON'S STORY.</h3>

<p align="justify"><a href="images/0154.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0154.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt=
"Ornamental 'T'"></a> wo little boys, Robert and Samuel, were one
day assisting the gardener about some flower-beds. They were rather
young to be of much service to the old man, and gave him some
trouble, once in a while, by the clumsy way in which they did their
work. Still, they meant to please the gardener, and he ought not to
have got out of patience, if they did now and then make a blunder.
Well, he was usually very patient and kind; but that day, for some
reason or another, things did not go right with him at all. Pianos
and violins, though they sometimes make sweet music, get out of
tune occasionally, and then, no matter what you try to play on
them, nothing sounds well. It is so with men and women too often;
and with boys and girls, too, it is to be feared. At any rate, it
was so with Mr Mason's gardener, at the time I speak of. He was
peevish and fretful, and said some harsh things to Robert, because
he accidentally destroyed a fine tulip with his spade. Robert
cried, and said he did not mean to do it. Then the old man was
sorry, but, probably feeling too proud to confess it, he was silent
for a long time. By and by, however, he told Robert that his
conscience troubled him on account of his speaking so unkindly, and
he hoped the little boy would forgive him. So you see the gardener
was a good man, although he was hasty at that time. Robert
cheerfully forgave him, and things went on a good deal better. The
boys tried to be more careful, and the gardener tried to be more
patient.</p>

"images/thumb/0155.jpg" border="0" alt=
"THE GARDENER REPROVING ROBERT."></a><br>THE GARDENER REPROVING ROBERT.</p>

<p align="justify">Robert thought a good deal about the old man's
mention of conscience, and when he saw his father, he asked him
what the conscience meant.</p>

<p align="justify">Robert's father liked to have his children make
such inquiries, and did all that he could to encourage them in
doing so.</p>

<p align="justify">"There are two ways, Robert," said he, "of
explaining things. One is by telling what they are, directly, and
the other is by telling what they do. I find that my children
generally like the last of these methods better than they do the
first; and I am not sure but, on the whole, it is quite as good as
the other. At any rate, I shall try to describe conscience by
pointing out some of its effects. In other words, I shall tell you
a story. Some twenty-five years ago&mdash;it may be thirty; how time
slides away!&mdash;I knew a boy who had one of the kindest of mothers,
but whose father had died before his recollection. I think&mdash;indeed
I know&mdash;he loved his mother, though he was sometimes thoughtless,
and once in a while disobedient. One day, in midsummer, when the
blackberries were ripe in the woods, and the trout were sporting
merrily in the brook, Charles&mdash;for that was the name of the
boy&mdash;came running to his mother, all out of breath, and said that
Joseph Cone and Charley Corson had come with their baskets and
fish-lines, and wanted he should go with them. 'Oh, such fine times
as they are going to have, mother! Mayn't I go? Blackberries are
ripe now, and there are lots of them over in Mr Simpson's woods.
And oh! such splendid trout! One of the boys caught a trout last
Saturday, so big that he couldn't hardly pull it out of the water!
Oh, I <i>do</i> want to go, mother! I'll bring home a fine string
of trout&mdash;I know I will. Ha! ha! ha!' And Charley danced up and
down the room, and clapped his hands, and laughed very loudly at
the idea, I suppose, of his outwitting the simple little fish."</p>

<p align="justify">Robert laughed, too, when his father came to
this part of the story, and said he thought that was something like
counting the chickens before they were hatched.</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes," continued Mr Mason; "but I am afraid that
was not the worst of it, by a good deal; for Charles knew well
enough that his mother wanted him at home that day, and he ought
not to have urged her so hard. 'My dear,' said that kind, indulgent
lady, 'I will let you do just as you choose about going. You know I
want you to help me about the house to-day, and I should be very
sorry to have you leave me. But I don't wish to govern you by
force. I want to see you mind because you love me&mdash;not because you
are obliged to. So I shall not say any more. Do as you please, this
time.'</p>

<p align="justify">"Charles thought a moment or two. He saw plainly
enough that there were two sides to the question about going
a-fishing that day. His mother was not very well. He thought of
that; and he thought that if he went, she would have more work to
do, and perhaps she would then be quite sick. His conscience was at
work, you see. 'Well,' he thought, 'I guess I will let the trout
stay where they are to-day,' But just then he heard one of the boys
say, 'Halloo, Charley! what do you say? We're tired of waiting.
Shall we go without you, or will you come along?'</p>

<p align="justify">"Well, what do you think Charley did,
Robert?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Why, he stayed at home, and helped his mother,
of course."</p>

<p align="justify">"No, I'm sorry to say that he changed his mind,
and started off with the boys. His conscience said <i>no</i>, but
his will said <i>yes</i>."</p>

<p align="justify">"Then he did very wrong."</p>

<p align="justify">"So I think. But the truth must be told. Charley
took his fishing apparatus, and whistled for his little dog, Caper,
and away the three boys ran, toward the brook.</p>

<p align="justify">"'Let's go to the deep hole under the elm tree.
That's where Bill Havens caught the big trout, the other day,' said
one.</p>

<p align="justify">"Bill Havens, as they called him, was one of the
most noted fishermen in the place. I knew him well. He was always
sure to succeed, wherever and whenever he went out with his hook
and line. I have been to this deep hole with Bill Havens, more than
once, and have seen him catch half a dozen large pickerel, when I
could not, by any of my skill, persuade a single fish to come out
of the brook.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/0160.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0160.jpg" border="0" alt=
"BILL HAVENS AT THE DEEP HOLE."></a><br>BILL HAVENS AT THE DEEP HOLE.</p>

<p align="justify">"'But we shall have to cross the brook,' said
Charley, 'and how in the world are we going to do that? The
foot-bridge was swept away by the freshet, you know.'</p>

<p align="justify">"'Oh, I'll see about that. I know where there's
an old tree that lies clear across the stream. We can get over on
that, just as well as we could over the foot-bridge,'</p>

<p align="justify">"And so they started for the old tree, which was
to serve them for a bridge. It had been blown down by the wind, and
had fallen across the stream, so that the large end rested on the
side where the boys were, while the upper limbs reached the
opposite bank. When the boys got to the tree, they saw that it was
not quite so convenient a bridge as they could wish; and Charley
Mason, who was not by any means a headstrong lad, and not used to
such adventures, said he would rather not attempt to cross it. But
the other two boys laughed at him, and told him not to be a coward;
and he finally determined he would venture, if the others
succeeded. They did succeed, and Charley, not without some
trembling&mdash;which, of course, made his danger the greater&mdash;prepared
to follow. 'Take care, Charley! take care! Rather dangerous
business, isn't it? Cling closely to the tree. There&mdash;so. Don't
look down into the water, or you'll be dizzy. That's the way. Come
on, now. Don't hang on to that dry limb! It will break and let you
fall into the water, if you do. How the poor fellow trembles!
<i>Plash</i>! There he goes, I declare!'</p>

"CHARLES CROSSING THE BROOK."></a><br>CHARLES CROSSING THE BROOK.</p>

<p align="justify">"Sure enough, Charles had slipped and fallen
into the stream! and his companions, so frightened that they hardly
knew what they did, took to their heels, and ran as fast as they
could toward home!"</p>

<p align="justify">"Poor Charley! he was drowned, then?" said
Robert.</p>

<p align="justify">"No, he managed to get out of the water; but he
had a hard time of it, though. He could not swim very well, at the
best; and with all his clothes on, it was as much as he could do to
swim at all. If the river had been a little wider, he never could
have got out alone. As it was, however, by the help of some rocks
there were in the brook, he reached the shore, pretty thoroughly
exhausted, and not a little frightened. His zeal for trout-fishing
was by this time a good deal cooled off, as you may suppose. The
nearest he came to catching any of those cunning little fellows
that day, was when he tumbled into the brook; and then he had
something else to think of.</p>

<p align="justify">"There he was, alone, wet as a drowned rat, and
shivering, partly from cold and partly from fright, as if he had
the ague. Poor fellow! His conscience began to be heard again, now
he had time to think. He hardly knew what to do; he was ashamed to
go home to his mother; and there he stood, for a good while,
leaning his head on the fence near the water, the tears all the
time chasing each other down his cheeks."</p>

<p align="justify">"I don't wonder he cried," said Robert; "but I
can't help laughing to think what a sorry figure he must have made
there, on the bank! And he was going to bring home such a nice
string of fish, too! I wonder if his mother did not laugh when she
saw him coming. Did he stay there, father, shivering and crying,
till some body came after him?"</p>

"CHARLES, AFTER THE DUCKING."></a><br>CHARLES, AFTER THE DUCKING.</p>

<p align="justify">"No, he started for home before any of the
neighbors reached the spot where he fell into the river; and, as
they missed him on the way, they supposed he was drowned, and
searched for his body half an hour or more, till they learned he
was safe at home."</p>

<p align="justify">"Well, what did his mother say to him,
father?"</p>

<p align="justify">"She did not say much, poor woman. She was not
well, as I said before, when Charles left her; and as her servant
had gone away for a week, and she had no one but him to assist her
in her work, she became very much fatigued; and when she heard that
Charles had fallen into the river, she fainted immediately. She had
hardly recovered when the boy reached the house."</p>

<p align="justify">"I think Charles was a very bad boy."</p>

<p align="justify">"Not so much worse than many others, perhaps, as
you may suppose. You judge of the boy's conduct by the consequences
of it. If he had been successful in his trout-fishing, and no
accident had happened to his mother, you would not have thought
half as much of his guilt in acting contrary to his mother's
wishes."</p>

<p align="justify">"Certainly not."</p>

<p align="justify">"But the boy would have been just as bad, for
all that."</p>

<p align="justify">"I can't see how, father."</p>

<p align="justify">"Why, the boy, when he was thinking what he
would do about going on that fishing excursion, could not have
foreseen all that would happen if he went. Do you think he
could?"</p>

<p align="justify">"No, sir, not all, I suppose. But I am sure he
was a very bad boy, whether he knew what would happen or not."</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes, no doubt. But I want you to see exactly
where his guilt lay. It was simply in his not yielding to his
mother's wish, when she so kindly left him at liberty to do as he
chose; especially as he knew she was ill, and needed his
assistance."</p>

<p align="justify">"Charley deserved a good whipping."</p>

<p align="justify">"Well, he <i>was</i> punished severely."</p>

<p align="justify">"Did his mother punish him?"</p>

<p align="justify">"No, for weeks she was too ill for that; and if
she had been well, probably she would not have punished him."</p>

<p align="justify">"How did he get punished?"</p>

<p align="justify">"By his own conscience. He felt that he had done
wrong, and that made him very unhappy. He saw, then, that he had
been very unkind to his mother, and that his unkindness cost her
pain and sorrow. He would rather have given all his
playthings&mdash;every one of his toys&mdash;than to feel as he did then.
Indeed, I think he would prefer the severest punishment from his
mother, to the wound which his conscience inflicted. Do you
understand now, my son, what is meant by conscience?"</p>

<p align="justify">"I think I do. When we are sorry for any thing
we have done, it is the conscience that makes us feel so."</p>

<p align="justify">"Not always. Charles was no doubt very sorry he
had tried to cross the river on the tree, because he fell into the
water, and came near being drowned. But the conscience had nothing
to do with this sorrow. When we see that we have carelessly or
wilfully injured some one&mdash;hurt his feelings, perhaps&mdash;or when we
reflect that we have disobeyed God, and feel grieved and sorry on
this account, then the conscience is the cause of our pain. So you
see that it is one of the numerous proofs of the wisdom and the
goodness of God, that he has given mankind a conscience. Take care,
my son, that you listen to its voice."</p>

<h2>OLD NED.</h2>

<p align="justify"><a href="images/0168.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0168.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt=
"Ornamental 'N'"></a> ot many years ago, Farmer Jones had an old
horse named "Ned," who appeared to have almost as much sense as
some people. Ned was a favorite with his master, who petted him as
if he were a child instead of a dumb animal. The horse seemed to
understand every word that the farmer said to him, and would obey
him quite as readily and with as much intelligence as Rover, the
house dog. If his master came into the field where he was grazing,
Ned would come galloping up to meet him, and then caper round as
playfully, though not, it must be owned, as gracefully, as a
kitten.</p>

<p align="justify">Farmer Jones, on these occasions, generally had
an ear or two of corn in his pocket; and Ned, whose nose had been
many a time in that capacious receptacle of odds and ends, after
sweeping around his master two or three times, would stop short and
come sideling up, half coquetishly, yet with a knowing twinkle in
his eye, and commence a search for the little tidbit that he had
good reason for knowing lay snugly stored away in the pocket.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/0169.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0169.jpg" border="0" alt="OLD NED."></a><br>OLD NED.</p>

<p align="justify">If any one besides his master went into the
field and tried to catch Ned, he was sure to have a troublesome
time of it; and if he succeeded in his object before circling the
field a dozen times in pursuit of the horse, he might think himself
lucky. But a word or a motion of the hand from Farmer Jones was
all-sufficient. Ned would become, instantly, as docile as a child,
trot up to his side, and stand perfectly still to receive the
saddle and bridle.</p>

<p align="justify">When Farmer Jones was on the back of Ned, or
sitting behind him in the old chaise, no horse could be more even
in his gait, or more orderly in all his movements. But it wasn't
safe for any one else to try the experiment of riding or driving
him. If he escaped without a broken neck, he might think himself
exceedingly fortunate; for the moment any one but his master
attempted to govern his actions in any way, he became possessed
with a spirit that was sometimes more than mischievous. He would
kick up, bite, wheel suddenly around, rear up on his hind feet, and
do almost every thing except go ahead in an orderly way, as a
respectable horse ought to have done.</p>

<p align="justify">Ned was too great a favorite with his master for
the latter to think of trying very hard to correct him of these bad
practices. He would talk to him, sometimes, about the folly of an
old horse like him prancing about, and cutting up as many antics as
a young colt; but his words, it was clear, went into one of Ned's
ears and out of the other, as people say, for Ned did not in the
least mend his manners, although he would nod his head in a knowing
and obedient way, while his master was talking to him.</p>

<p align="justify">Ned spent at least two thirds of his time, from
the period when the grass sprung up, tender and green, until it
became pale and crisp with frost, in a three-acre field belonging
to his master, where he ate, walked about, rolled himself on the
soft sward, or slept away the hours, as happy as a horse could be.
Across one corner of this field a little boy and his sister used
every day to go to school. The little boy was a namesake of the
horse; but he was usually called Neddy. One day Neddy felt rather
mischievous, as little boys will feel sometimes. He had a long
willow switch in his hand, and was cutting away at every thing that
came within his reach. He frightened a brood of chickens, and
laughed merrily to see them scamper in every direction; he made an
old hog grunt, and a little pig squeal, and was even so thoughtless
as to strike with his slender switch a little lamb, that lay close
beside its mother on the soft grass.</p>

<p align="justify">"Don't, don't, Neddy," Jane, his sister, would
say.</p>

<p align="justify">But the little fellow gave no heed to her words.
At last, in crossing the field, they came to where the old horse
lay under the shade of a great walnut tree. The temptation to let
him have a taste of the switch was too strong for Neddy to resist;
so he passed up close to the horse, and gave him a smart cut across
the shoulders.</p>

<p align="justify">Now that was an indignity to which the old
fellow was not prepared to submit. Why, it was at least ten years
since the stroke of a whip had been felt upon his glossy skin. Whip
and spur were of the times long since gone by. Springing up as
quickly as if he were only a colt instead of a grave old horse, Ned
elevated his mane, and swept angrily around the now frightened lad,
neighing fiercely, and striking out into the air with his heels at
a furious rate. Jane and Neddy ran, but the horse kept up, and by
his acts threatening every moment to kill them. But, angry as the
old fellow was, he did not really intend to harm the children, who
at length reached the fence toward which they were flying. Jane got
safely over, but just as Neddy was creeping through the bars, the
horse caught hold of his loose coat, with his teeth, and pulled him
back into the field, where he turned him over and over on the grass
with his nose for half a dozen times, but without harming him in
the least, and then let him go, and went trotting back to the cool,
shady place under the old walnut tree, from which the switch of the
thoughtless boy had aroused him.</p>

<p align="justify">Neddy, you may be sure, was dreadfully
frightened, and went crying home. On the next day, when they came
to the field in which Ned lived at his ease and enjoyed himself,
the old horse was grazing in a far-off corner, and the children
thought they might safely venture to cross over. But they had only
gained half the distance, when Ned espied them, and, with a loud
neigh, gave chase at full gallop. The children ran, in great alarm,
for the fence, and got through, safely, before the horse came
up.</p>

<p align="justify">After this, whenever they ventured to cross the
field, Ned would interfere. Once he got Neddy's hat in his mouth,
and ran off with it. But he didn't harm it any, and after keeping
the children waiting at the fence for about half an hour, came and
threw it over; after which he kicked up both his heels in a defiant
manner, and giving a "horse laugh," scampered away as if a
locomotive were after him.</p>

<p align="justify">At last Neddy's father complained to Farmer
Jones of the way in which his old horse was annoying the children,
who had to pass through the field, as they went to school, or else
be compelled to go a long distance out of their way. The farmer
inquired the cause of Ned's strange conduct, and learned that the
little boy cut him across the shoulders with a willow switch.</p>

<p align="justify">"Ho! ho!" said he, "that's the trouble, is it?
Ned won't bear a stroke from any one. But I will make up the matter
between him and the children. So let them stop here on their way
from school this evening."</p>

<p align="justify">The children stopped accordingly. Ned was
standing in the barn-yard, the very picture of demure innocence.
But when he saw little Neddy and his sister, he pricked up his
ears, shook his head, and neighed.</p>

<p align="justify">"Come, come, old boy!" said the farmer, "we've
had enough of that. You must learn to forgive and forget. The
little fellow was only playing with you."</p>

<p align="justify">Ned appeared to understand his master, for he
looked a little ashamed of himself, and let his pointed ears fall
back again to their old places.</p>

<p align="justify">"Now, my little fellows," said Farmer Jones,
"take up a handful of that sweet new hay, and call him to the
bars."</p>

<p align="justify">"I'm afraid," returned Neddy. "He'll bite
me."</p>

<p align="justify">"Not he. Why the old horse wouldn't harm a hair
of your head. He was only trying to frighten you as a punishment
for the stroke you gave him. Come. Now's your time to make
friends."</p>

<p align="justify">Neddy, thus encouraged, gathered a handful of
the sweet new hay that was scattered around, and going up to the
fence, held it out and called to the horse&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"Here! Ned, Ned, Ned!"</p>

<p align="justify">The horse shook his head, and stood still.</p>

<p align="justify">"Come along, you old vagabond!" said Farmer
Jones, in a voice of reproof. "Don't you see the lad's sorry for
the cut he gave you? Now walk up to the bars, and forgive the
little fellow, as a sensible horse ought to do."</p>

<p align="justify">Ned no longer hesitated, but went up to the
bars, where Neddy, half trembling, awaited him, and took the sweet
morsel of hay from the child's hand. Jane, encouraged by this
evidence of docility, put her hand on the animal's neck, and
stroked his long head gently with her hand, while Neddy gathered
handful after handful of hay, and stood close by the mouth of the
old horse, as he ate it with the air of one who enjoyed
himself.</p>

<p align="justify">After that, the children could cross the field
again as freely as before, and if Ned noticed them at all, it was
in a manner so good natured as not to cause them the slightest
uneasiness.</p>

<h2>JULIA AND HER BIRDS.</h2>

<p align="justify"><a href="images/0179.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0179.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt=
"Ornamental 'L'"></a> ittle Julia Cornish, a young friend of mine,
is very fond of birds. It is no strange thing, I am aware, for
children to love birds. Indeed, I do not see how any body can help
loving the dear little things, especially those that fill the air
with their music. But Julia was unusually fond of them, and her
fondness showed itself in a great many ways. She did not shut them
up in cages. But she was so kind to those that had their liberty,
that many of them became quite as tame as if they had always lived
in a cage.</p>

<p align="justify">I must tell you about a robin that used to be a
pet of hers. You know the robin, do you not, reader? To my mind he
is one of the dearest of all our native songsters. His notes are
among the first we hear in the spring. And he is a very social and
confiding creature. How often he selects a place for his nest on
some tree near the house! and when it is built, while his partner
is busy with her domestic duties, he will sing for hours together
his song of love and tenderness.</p>

<p align="justify">Julia resided in the country; and every year the
robins built their nests on the trees in her father's orchard, near
the house. She fancied that the robins came from the South to her
door, year after year, and brought their children with them. She
was sure she could distinguish the voices of her old friends, and
she used to sit under the shade of the trees where they had their
nests, and talk to them kindly, and leave something good for them
to eat.</p>

<p align="justify">One year there were a pair of robins who made
their nest on a tree, the boughs of which hung over the house; and
Julia could sit in her window and see all that the little family
were doing. She was delighted with such a token of confidence, and
she and the robins soon became very intimate. The old ones
frequently flew down from their nest, and alighted near the door,
when Julia would give them as much food as they wanted, and let
them carry some home to their children.</p>

<p align="justify">By and by, the young robins were old enough to
leave their nests. That was a great day with both parents and
children, and all seemed about as merry as they could be when the
half-fledged little birds took their first lessons in flying,
though Julia laughed a good deal to see their manoeuvres, and said
their motions were awkward enough. However, they learned to fly
after a while, as well as their parents, though before they left
for the season, some cruel boy threw a stone at one of them and
broke his wing. Poor fellow! he suffered a great deal of pain, and
his parents and brothers and sisters were very sad about it. They
seemed for a while hardly to know what to do. Probably there were
no surgeons among them, who understood how to manage broken limbs.
And they had a long talk together&mdash;so Julia said&mdash;and finally hit
upon this plan. Willy&mdash;that was the name my friend gave to the lame
bird&mdash;was to go into the house, and see if something could not be
done for him there.</p>

<p align="justify">Accordingly, one bright morning in June, almost
as soon as breakfast was over, the little invalid, attended by the
rest of the family, came to the door, where Julia was waiting to
receive them&mdash;for she fed them regularly every day&mdash;and then, after
they had eaten what they wanted, instead of flying away, as they
were accustomed to do, little Willy hopped into the kitchen, while
the rest remained near the door. Julia thought that was queer
enough, and she ran and told her mother. "I wonder if I can coax
the little fellow to stay with me until his wing gets well," she
said. "I wish I could. Oh, I should dearly love to take care of
him, and I am sure we can make him well soon."</p>

"images/thumb/0182.jpg" border="0" alt=
"JULIA'S PET ROBIN."></a><br>JULIA'S PET ROBIN.</p>

<p align="justify">Little Willy did not say&mdash;at least he did not
say in our language&mdash;that he should be happy to place himself
awhile under his friend Julia's care. But he seemed very content,
and soon made himself quite at home. Though he had perfect liberty
to go just where he pleased, and would often venture out of the
house, yet he evidently considered himself an inmate of Mr
Cornish's family. Under the care especially of Miss Julia, he
became so tame that she could take him in her lap and stroke his
feathers. Willy was a great favorite in the family, after he had
been there a day or two. No one did any thing for his wing. They
did not understand setting birds' wings, when they were broken.
Still, Willy got better in a very short time, without the
assistance of a surgeon. A great many sick people, you know, need
the care of a nurse more than that of a doctor. That was the case
with Willy, it would seem. In less than three weeks his wing was
entirely well, and he was able to take care of himself. So he
warbled his adieu to the family under whose roof he had been so
kindly treated, and flew away with the other robins who had been
waiting for him.</p>

"JULIA FEEDING THE BIRDS."></a><br>JULIA FEEDING THE BIRDS.</p>

<p align="justify">Julia is very kind, too, to the snow-birds in
the winter. Many a time, when the snow has been deep, and these
hungry birds have come to her father's door, I have seen her
feeding them. One winter, I recollect, she had a flock of them that
she could call to her, when she wanted to feed them, just as she
could the chickens. The snow-bird is an interesting little creature;
and though he has not a very sweet voice for singing, he was always
a favorite with Julia, and I am not sure but I love the fellow as
well as she does. Winter to me would be a great deal more gloomy,
were it not for the Winter King, as Miss Gould calls this little
bird.</p>

<p align="justify">Did you know reader, that the snow-bird is a
very affectionate creature? It seems that it is so. Some years ago
one of them flew into a house, where, finding itself quite welcome,
it remained over night. By accident, however, it was killed in the
morning, and one of the servants threw it into the yard. In the
course of the day, one of the family witnessed a most affecting
scene in connection with the dead body. Its mate was standing
beside it, mourning its loss. It placed its beak below the head of
its companion, raised it up, and again warbled its song of
mourning. By and by it flew away, and returned with a grain or two
of wheat, which it dropped before its dead partner. Then it
fluttered its wings, and endeavored to call the attention of the
dead bird to the food. Again it flew away, again it returned, and
used the same efforts as before. At last, it took up a kernel of
the wheat, and dropped it into the beak of the dead bird. This was
repeated several times. Then the poor bereaved one sang in the same
plaintive strain as before. But the scene was too affecting for the
lady who witnessed it. She could bear the sight no longer, and
turned away. I have loved the snow-bird more than ever since this
story was told me, and so has my friend Julia.</p>

<p align="justify">Now I think of it, I have in one of the
storerooms of my memory, a song about the snow-bird. It is rather
simple and childish&mdash;possibly too much so for boys and girls of
your age. However, as we are somewhat musical just now, after
talking so much about birds, and are greatly in want of a song, I
will sing this about Emily and the Snow-Bird, and you may join in
the chorus, if you like.</p>

<p align="justify">"I don't wish to go into the house. Give me your
knife, I say. I only want it for a minute."</p>

<p align="justify">"I never lend my knife, nor give it, either,"
returned William. "Get your own."</p>

<p align="justify">"You are the most disobliging fellow I ever
saw," retorted Edgar, angrily, rising up and going into the house
to get his own knife. "Don't ever ask me for a favor, for I'll
never grant it."</p>

<p align="justify">This very unbrotherly conversation took place
just beneath the window near which Mr Harris, the father of the
lads, was seated. He overheard it all, and was grieved, as may be
supposed, that his sons should treat each other so unkindly. But he
said nothing to them then, nor did he let them know that he heard
the language that had passed between them.</p>

<p align="justify">In a little while Edgar returned, and as he sat
down in the place where he had been seated before, he said,</p>

<p align="justify">"No thanks to you for your old knife! Keep it to
yourself, in welcome. I wouldn't use it now, if you were to give it
to me."</p>

<p align="justify">"I'm glad you are so independent," retorted
William. "I hope you will always be so."</p>

<p align="justify">And the boys fretted each other for some
time.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/0193.jpg"><img src=

"THE TWO BROTHERS AT PLAY."></a><br>THE TWO BROTHERS AT PLAY.</p>

<p align="justify">On the next day, Edgar was building a house with
sticks, and William was rolling a hoop. By accident the hoop was
turned from its right course, and broke down a part of Edgar's
house. William was just going to say how sorry he was for the
accident, and to offer to repair the damage that was done, when his
brother, with his face red with passion, cried out&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"Just see what you have done! If you don't clear
out with your hoop, I'll call father. You did it on purpose."</p>

<p align="justify">"Do go and call him! I'll go with you," said
William, in a sneering, tantalizing tone. "Come, come along
now."</p>

<p align="justify">For a little while the boys stood and growled at
each other like two ill-natured dogs, and then Edgar commenced
repairing his house, and William went to rolling his hoop again.
The latter was strongly tempted to repeat, in earnest, what he had
done at first by accident, by way of retaliation upon his brother
for his spiteful manner toward him; but, being naturally of a good
disposition, and forgiving in his temper, he soon forgot his bad
feelings, and enjoyed his play as much as he had done before.</p>

<p align="justify">This little circumstance Mr Harris had also
observed.</p>

<p align="justify">A day or two afterward, Edgar came to his father
with a complaint against his brother.</p>

<p align="justify">"I never saw such a boy," he said. "He won't do
the least thing to oblige me. If I ask him to lend me his knife, or
ball, or any thing he has, he snaps me up short with a
refusal."</p>

<p align="justify">"Perhaps you don't ask him right," suggested the
father. "Perhaps you don't speak kindly to him. I hardly think that
William is ill-disposed and disobliging naturally. There must be
some fault on your part, I am sure."</p>

<p align="justify">"I don't know how I can be in fault, father,"
said Edgar.</p>

<p align="justify">"William refused to let you have his knife, the
other day, although he was not using it himself, did he not?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes, sir."</p>

<p align="justify">"Do you remember how you asked him for it?"</p>

<p align="justify">"No, sir, not now, particularly."</p>

<p align="justify">"Well, as I happened to overhear you, I can
repeat your words, though I hardly think I can get your very tone
and manner. Your words were, 'Here, lend me your knife, Bill!' and
your voice and manner were exceedingly offensive. I did not at all
wonder that William refused your request. If you had spoken to him
in a kind manner, I am sure he would have handed you his knife,
instantly. But no one likes to be ordered, in a domineering way, to
do any thing at all. I know you would resent it in William, as
quickly as he resents it in you. Correct your own fault, my son,
and in a little while you will have no complaint to make of
William."</p>

<p align="justify">Edgar felt rebuked. What his father said he saw
to be true.</p>

<p align="justify">"Whenever you want William to do any thing for
you," continued the father, "use kind words instead of harsh ones,
and you will find him as obliging as you could wish. I have
observed you both a good deal, and I notice that you rarely ever
speak to William in a proper manner, but are rude and overbearing.
Correct this evil in yourself, and all will be right with him. Kind
words are far more powerful than harsh words, and their effect a
hundred-fold greater."</p>

<p align="justify">On the next day, as Edgar was at work in the
garden, and William standing at the gate, looking on, Edgar wanted
a rake that was in the summer-house. He was just going to say, "Go
and get me that rake, Bill!" but he checked himself, and made his
request in a different form, and in a better tone than those words
would have been uttered in.</p>

<p align="justify">"Won't you get me the small rake that lies in
the summer-house, William?" he said. The words and tone involved a
request, not a command, and William instantly replied&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"Certainly;" and bounded away to get the rake
for his brother.</p>

<p align="justify">"Thank you," said Edgar, as he received the
rake.</p>

<p align="justify">"Don't you want the watering-pot?" asked
William.</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes, I do; and you may bring it full of water,
if you please," was the reply.</p>

<p align="justify">Off William went for the watering-pot, and soon
returned with it full of water. As he stood near one of Edgar's
flower-beds, he forgot himself, and stepped back with his foot upon
a bed of pansies.</p>

<p align="justify">"There! just look at you!" exclaimed Edgar,
thrown off his guard.</p>

<p align="justify">William, who had felt drawn toward his brother
on account of his kind manner, was hurt at this sudden change in
his words and tone. He was tempted to retort harshly, and even to
set his foot more roughly upon the pansies. But he checked himself,
and, turning away, walked slowly from the garden.</p>

<p align="justify">Edgar, who had repented of his rude words and
unkind manner the moment he had time to think, was very sorry that
he had been thrown off his guard, and resolved to be more careful
in the future. And he was more careful. The next time he spoke to
his brother, it was in a kind and gentle manner, and he saw its
effect. Since then, he has been watchful over himself, and now he
finds that William is one of the most obliging boys any where to be
found.</p>

<p align="justify">"So much for kind words, my son," said his
father, on noticing the great change that had taken place. "Never
forget, throughout your whole life, that kind words are far more
potent than harsh ones. I have found them so, and you have already
proved the truth of what I say."</p>

<p align="justify">And so will every one who tries them. Make the
experiment, young friends, and you will find it to succeed in every
case.</p>

<h2>PASSING FOR MORE THAN ONE IS WORTH.</h2>

<p align="justify"><a href="images/0199.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0199.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt=
"Ornamental 'O'"></a> he other day I had occasion to pay a man half
a dollar, and gave him a dollar bank note, for which he gave me in
exchange two silver pieces that I supposed to be worth twenty-five
cents each. One of the pieces, however, I found afterward would
only go for sixteen or seventeen cents. It was not a quarter of a
dollar, though it looked very much like one. It had passed for some
eight or nine cents more than it was worth. Well, that was an
affair of very little consequence, you say. True enough, but I am
going to take hold of something else with this handle, that may be
of more consequence.</p>

<p align="justify">There are a great many folks in the world who,
like this pistareen, pass themselves off, or try to pass themselves
off, for more than their real value. It is bad business, though;
and they always feel <i>cheap</i> when they get found out, as they
are sure to be in the end.</p>

<p align="justify">Did you ever see a dandy under a full press of
canvas, as the sailors say, showing himself off on one of the
principal streets of a city&mdash;on Broadway, for instance, in New
York? He was trying to pass himself off for more than his worth.
And no doubt he succeeded, too, in some instances. By the way, do
you know what definition Webster gives of a dandy in his large
dictionary? It is worth remembering. Suppose we turn to it. "A
dandy," says he, "is one who dresses himself like a doll, and
carries his character on his back." It is a most capital
definition; but the silly fellow will pass for something else where
he is not known. He will make a great swell, and some people will
believe he is a gentleman. Indeed, it would not be strange if he
should pass himself off, one of these days, upon some young lady
who is quite ignorant of this kind of currency, as an Italian
count, or, perhaps, the marquis of this or the duke of that. There
is no telling. But if she takes him for a cent more than Webster
rates him at, she gets cheated, depend upon it. He is not worth the
clothes on his back. He has to cross the street sometimes, to get
rid of being dunned by his tailor; and he has been two or three
hours trying to find a barber who will trust him. He's nothing but
a pistareen, and hardly that.</p>

<p align="justify">Some people pass themselves off for being very
learned, when they are as ignorant as a horse-block. But, oh! such
mistakes as they make sometimes; it is enough to set one into a fit
of laughter, only to think of some of them. I know a miss, who
tries to pass herself off for a great reader, when the truth is,
she has only dipped up a spoon-full, here and there, from a score
or two of authors, and has not the slightest idea about the merits
of any of them. Some one came up with her nicely the other night,
at a party. He had suspicions, I suppose, that she was trying to
pass for too much; at all events, he asked her a great many
roundabout questions, which she was obliged to answer, and in doing
so she let out the secret. Every body saw what sort of a coin she
was, at once.</p>

<p align="justify">What fools some folks make of themselves, by
attempting to pass for more than they are worth, in the matter of
dollars and cents. It is said, that in the city of New York there
are a good many poor fellows that can scarcely get enough money to
appear in a respectable suit of clothes, who will buy a dinner in
some cheap eating-house for sixpence, and then pick their teeth on
the door-steps of the Astor House, to make people think they have
dined there. And that is not any worse than some would-be genteel
people manage when the warm season comes on, every year. They close
their front window blinds, and steal into and out of their houses
like thieves, or dogs that have just had a flogging, so that their
neighbors will think they have gone to Saratoga, or Rockaway, or
some other fashionable summer retreat. They take a good deal of
pains to pass for so much more than they are worth&mdash;do they not,
little friend? They only go for pistareens, though, where they are
known.</p>

<p align="justify">One sometimes comes across a public speaker&mdash;a
lawyer&mdash;possibly a preacher&mdash;who displays his eloquence by using
all sorts of long and out-of-the-way words. A man may be listening
ever so quietly and innocently, and the first thing he knows, down
comes a word about his ears half as long as his arm almost, and
half as heavy as a mallet. That is what the orator calls a
<i>knock-down</i> argument; and when he wishes to be particularly
convincing and eloquent, he throws at you such brick-bats and bars
of iron as
incomprehensibility&mdash;epexegetically&mdash;anthropopathically&mdash;so fast
that you have scarcely a chance to dodge one before another comes
whizzing along. Of course, you are confounded with the man's
assault and battery, and if you are a thinking person, perhaps fall
to musing how such monstrous words can come out of a man's throat
whole, without choking him, or themselves splitting to pieces. When
I hear a public speaker going on in that way, I generally think
that the poor fellow is making up in big words what he lacks in
brains, and if I could whisper a small word or two in his ear, I
should be apt to say, "That will never do, sir. You can't pass
yourself off for a great scholar with this clap-trap. You are
nothing but a pistareen, and rather smooth at that. You are,
indeed. Those big words that we have to bend up and twist around to
get into our coat-pockets, will not go for sense. So pray be quiet,
and not attempt to pass for any more than you are honestly worth,
which is little enough, to be sure."</p>

<p align="justify">I have known boys and girls at school attempt to
pass for more than their real value. Whenever I hear a boy asking
somebody to write a composition for him, or to help him write one,
which he intends to palm off as his own, or see him jog the boy
that sits next him in the school-room, to get some help in reciting
a bad lesson, I think of the pistareen, and want very much to
caution the little fellow not to pass for more than he is worth.
And it makes very little difference that I know of, whether it is a
boy or a girl. It seems just as bad in one case as it does in the
other.</p>

<p align="justify">It happens once in a while that a young lady
puts on a great many charms that are not natural to her, and uses
every kind of deception, just for the sake of being admired, or,
perhaps, to get a good husband. It is bad business, though.
Sensible men are not often caught with such a trap; and if they
are, when they find out how the matter stands&mdash;and they will find
it out sooner or later&mdash;they despise the trick as one of the
meanest that was ever invented. I have a notion, too, that this
kind of deception is pretty common among young gentlemen, as well
as young ladies. But it is a miserable business, whoever may work
at it. It never turns out well in the end, if it does after a
fashion at first. It is a great deal better to be natural, and to
act like one's self. This passing for more than one is worth, to
buy a husband or a wife, as the case may be, don't pay, as the
merchant says.</p>

<p align="justify">Some people work like a horse in a bark-mill, to
make every body believe they are most excellent Christians, very
nearly as pious as the angel Gabriel, when the truth is, their
religion is all sham, and they will lie and cheat as bad as any
body, if they think they will not be found out. Whenever I see one
of this class, trying with all his might to pass for a saint, with
his face as long as a yard-stick, or, perhaps, all lighted up with
kindly smiles, I can't help thinking of the pistareen. It will come
into my mind in spite of all I can do. Why, all the time the man is
putting on these airs, he is plotting some scheme for selfish gain,
or some mischief, just as likely as not. "He does not rise toward
heaven like the lark, to make music, but like the hawk, to dart
down upon his prey. If he goes up the Mount of Olives to kneel in
prayer, he is about to build an oil-mill up there. If he weeps by
the brook Kedron, he is making ready to fish for eels, or else to
drown somebody in the stream." Poor man! he has a hard time of it,
trying to keep up appearances. But it will be harder still, by and
by, if he does not look out. He cannot carry his mask with him into
the other world. There no one will pass for any more than he is
worth.</p>

Oh! when shall I leave my dull prison again?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pining to roam 'mid the wild flowers free.</p>

<p>O green is the turf in the wildwood now,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my spirit flies from the dwellings of men,<br>
Where the wind blows soft through the cedar's bough,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the voice of the streamlet is heard from the
glen.</p>

<p>This dim-lighted chamber I long to resign<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For my cherish'd retreat, 'neath the wide-spreading

<h2>THE USE OF FLOWERS<small>[<a href="#fn1">1</a>]</small>.</h2>

"Ornamental 'J'"></a> ust one moment longer, cousin Mary, I want to
put this flower in your hair. Now doesn't it look sweet, sister
Aggy?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, yes! very sweet. And here is the dearest
little bud I ever saw. I took it from the sweet-briar bush in the
lane. Put that, too, in cousin Mary's hair."</p>

<p align="justify">Little Florence, seeing what was going on, was
soon, also, at work upon Mary's hair, that, in a little while, was
covered with buds and blossoms.</p>

<p align="justify">"Now she is our May Queen," said the children,
as they hung fondly around their cousin, who had come out into the
country to enjoy a few weeks of rural quiet, in the season of
fruits and flowers. "And our May Queen must sing us a song," said
Agnes, who was sitting at the feet of her cousin. "Sing us
something about flowers."</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, yes!" spoke up Grace, "sing us that
beautiful piece by Mrs Howitt, about the use of flowers. You sang
it for us, you remember, the last time you were here."</p>

<p align="justify">Cousin Mary sang as desired. After she had
concluded, she said&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"Flowers, according to these beautiful verses,
are only useful as objects to delight our senses. They are only
beautiful forms in nature&mdash;their highest use, their beauty and
fragrance."</p>

<p align="justify">"I think that is what Mrs Howitt means," replied
Grace. "So I have always understood her. And I cannot see any other
use that flowers have. Do you know of any other use, cousin?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, yes. Flowers have a more important use than
merely giving delight to the senses. Without them, plants could not
produce fruit and seed. You notice that the flower always comes
before the fruit?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, yes. But why is a flower needed? Why does
not the fruit push itself directly out from the stem of a plant?"
asked Agnes.</p>

<p align="justify">"Flowers are the most exquisitely delicate in
their texture of all forms in the vegetable kingdom. Look at the
petals of this one. Could any thing be softer or finer? The leaf,
the bark, and the wood of the plant are all coarse, in comparison
to the flower. Now, as nothing is made in vain, there must be some
reason for this. The leaves and bark, as well as wood, of plants,
all have vessels through which sap flows, and this sap nourishes,
sustains, and builds up the plant, as our blood does our bodies.
But the whole effort of the plant is to reproduce itself; and to
this end it forms seed, which, when cast into the ground, takes
root, springs up, and makes a new plant. To form this seed,
requires the purest juices of the plant, and these are obtained by
means of the flowers, through the exquisitely fine vessels of which
these juices are filtered, or strained, and thus separated from all
that is gross and impure."</p>

<p align="justify">"I never thought of that before," said Agnes.
"Flowers, then, are useful, as well as beautiful."</p>

<p align="justify">"Nothing is made for mere beauty. All things in
nature regard use as an end. To flowers are assigned a high and
important use, and exquisite beauty of form and color is at the
same time given to them; and with these our senses are delighted.
They are, in more respects than one, good gifts from our heavenly
Father."</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh! how I do love the flowers," said Agnes;
"and now, when I look upon them, and think of their use as well as
their beauty, I will love them still more. Are they so very
beautiful because their use is such an important one, cousin
Mary?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes, dear; I believe this is so. In the seeds
of plants there is an image of the infinity of our great Creator;
for in seeds resides a power, or an effort, to reproduce the
plants, that lie concealed as gems within them, to infinity. We
might naturally enough suppose that flowers, whose use it is to
refine and prepare the juices of plants, so as to free them from
all grosser matters, and make them fit for the important office of
developing and maturing seeds, would be exceedingly delicate in
their structure, and, as a natural consequence, beautiful to look
upon. And we will believe, therefore, that their peculiar beauty
depends upon their peculiar use."</p>

<h2>SLIDING DOWN HILL.</h2>

<p align="justify"><a href="images/0213.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0213.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt=
"Ornamental 'S'"></a> ay what you will&mdash;talk about cold hands,
feet, and noses, as much as you please&mdash;there are about as fine
sports in winter as we get in the whole year. There is something
very exciting in snow. A snow storm acts like electricity upon the
spirits of the boys&mdash;and girls too, for that matter. How busy we
used to be, on Saturday afternoon, when there was no school, as
soon as the first flakes of snow had whitened the ground, making
new sleds, and mending up old ones.</p>

<p align="justify">Our southern readers know very little about
these sports of winter. I have a good mind to enlighten them a
little. Imagine, my young friends&mdash;you who live so near the tropics
that snow and ice are objects of curiosity&mdash;imagine, if you can,
the earth covered to the depth of two feet or more with snow. In
some places, the drifts are as high as your head, and higher too.
When it first falls, the particles are loosely thrown together; but
a warm sun or a little shower of rain melts them down a little, and
then comes a night cold enough to freeze up your mouth, if you
don't look out, and the surface of the snow becomes hard and
slippery. Then such a time as the boys have sliding down hill&mdash;why,
it is worth coming up as far north as New York, and running the
risk of having your fingers frozen a little, to see them at it, and
take a few trips down the hill.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/0214.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0214.jpg" border="0" alt=
"SLIDING DOWN HILL."></a><br>SLIDING DOWN HILL.</p>

<p align="justify">A sled constructed for this purpose is a very
simple thing. I will sketch one for you. Here it is, and a boy
carrying it up the hill.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/0215.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0215.jpg" border="0" alt="[Illustration]"></a></p>

<p align="justify">When the boy gets to the top of the hill, he
sometimes lies and sometimes sits up on his sled, and lets it go.
It finds its way down, without any of the boy's help, you may
depend upon it. He has to guide it a little with his feet, though.
If he did not, he might come in contact with another boy's sled, or
a rock, perhaps; and that would be rather a serious joke, when the
sled was going like the cars on a railroad.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/0216.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0216.jpg" border="0" alt="[Illustration]"></a></p>

<p align="justify">Sometimes there are a dozen boys, all or nearly
all with a sled of their own, sliding down the same hill at once.
In fact, we used to have the whole school at it, now and then, when
I was a little boy. It was a merry time then, you may be sure.
Occasionally we would have a large sled, which it took three or
four boys to draw up the hill. Then half a dozen of us would get
on, and slide down in advance of the wind, it seemed to me&mdash;for it
was so swift that I scarcely could breathe&mdash;until we came up all
standing in a huge snow bank.</p>

<p align="justify">Sometimes, when we were half way down, and our
locomotive was under a full pressure of steam, a boy would fall
off, and, not being able to check the force he received from the
sled, would go down to the bottom of the hill in a manner
calculated to raise a very stormy concert of laughter from the rest
of the boys. And the poor John Gilpin enjoyed the fun, too, or
tried to enjoy it, as much as any of them, though he did not laugh
quite so heartily; and he could well be pardoned for not doing
that, certainly, until he had got to the end of his ludicrous
race.</p>

<p align="justify">I can recollect a great many funny adventures
connected with sliding down hill. I don't know that I ever laughed
more in my life at any one time, than I did once at a feat of Jack
Mason's. Jack was a courageous fellow&mdash;one of the most daring boys
in the whole school. Some thirty or forty of us were one bright
Saturday afternoon sliding down a fine hill, with a good level
valley at its foot, when Jack challenged the boys to go down the
other side, which was a great deal steeper, and which had an
immense drift of snow at the bottom. No one dared to do it. We all
thought it would be rather too serious business. Jack surveyed the
ground for a few minutes, and screwed his courage up to the highest
point. "I am going down," said he. We tried to dissuade him, but it
was of no use. When Jack had made up his mind, you might as well
attempt to turn the course of the north wind as to turn him. The
words were no sooner out of his mouth, than down he went, like an
arrow. We trembled for him, and held our breath almost, as we
watched his sled; for it used to be a proverb with us, that Jack
would break his neck one of these days, and we were not without our
fears that the day had come.</p>

<p align="justify">Down went Jack on his sled, and in a few moments
he was plunged in the snow bank out of sight. We all ran down to
dig him out, scarcely daring to hope we should find him alive. We
worked like beavers for a considerable time, and found nothing of
the poor adventurer. At last, more than a rod from where he entered
the bank, up popped Jack, as white with snow as if he had been into
a flour barrel, tugging his sled after him, and grinning like a
right merry fellow, as he was. Take it all in all, it was one of
the most laughable sights I ever saw; and now as I write, and a
sort of a daguerreotype likeness of Jack, just emerging, like a
ghost, from that snow bank, comes up to my mind, I have to stop and
laugh almost as heartily as I did at the scene itself, when it
occurred.</p>

"Ornamental 'F'"></a> ather, I don't like to go to school," said
Harry Williams, one morning. "I wish you would let me always stay
at home. Charles Parker's father don't make him go to school."</p>

<p align="justify">Mr Williams took his little boy by the hand, and
said kindly to him, "Come, my son, I want to show you something in
the garden."</p>

<p align="justify">Harry walked into the garden with his father,
who led him along until they came to a bed in which peas were
growing, the vines supported by thin branches that had been placed
in the ground. Not a weed was to be seen about their roots, nor
even disfiguring the walk around the bed in which they had been
planted.</p>

<p align="justify">"See how beautifully these peas are growing, my
son," said Mr Williams. "How clean and healthy the vines look. We
shall have an abundant crop. Now let me show you the vines in Mr
Parker's garden. We can look at them through a great hole in his
fence."</p>

<p align="justify">Mr Williams then led Harry through the garden
gate and across the road, to look at Mr Parker's pea vines through
the hole in the fence. The bed in which they were growing was near
to the road; so they had no difficulty in seeing it. After looking
into the garden for a few moments, Mr Williams said&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"Well, my son, what do you think of Mr Parker's
pea vines?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, father!" replied the little boy; "I never
saw such poor looking peas in my life! There are no sticks for them
to run upon, and the weeds are nearly as high as the peas
themselves. There won't be half a crop!"</p>

<p align="justify">"Why are they so much worse than ours,
Harry?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Because they have been left to grow as they
pleased. I suppose Mr Parker just planted them, and never took any
care of them afterward. He has neither taken out the weeds, nor
helped them to grow right."</p>

<p align="justify">"Yes, that is just the truth, my son. A garden
will soon be overrun with weeds and briars, if it is not cultivated
with the greatest care. And just so it is with the human garden.
This precious garden must be trained and watered, and kept free
from weeds, or it will run to waste. Children's minds are like
garden beds; and they must be as carefully tended, and even more
carefully, than the choicest plants. If you, my son, were never to
go to school, nor have good seeds of knowledge planted in your
mind, it would, when you become a man, resemble the weed-covered,
neglected bed we have just been looking at, instead of the
beautiful one in my garden. Would you think me right to neglect my
garden as Mr Parker neglects his?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, no, father; your garden is a good garden,
but Mr Parker's is all overrun with weeds and briars. It won't
yield half as much as yours will."</p>

<p align="justify">"Or, my son, do you think I would be right if I
neglected my son as Mr Parker neglects his son, allowing him to run
wild, and his mind, uncultivated, to become overgrown with
weeds?"</p>

<p align="justify">Little Harry made no reply; but he understood
pretty clearly what his father meant.</p>

<p align="justify">"I send you to school," Mr Williams continued,
"in order that the garden of your mind may have good seeds sown in
it, and that these seeds may spring up and grow, and produce
plentifully. Now which would you prefer, to stay at home from
school, and so let the garden of your mind be overrun with weeds,
or go to school, and have this garden cultivated?"</p>

<p align="justify">"I would rather go to school," said Harry. "But,
father, is Charles Parker's mind overrun with weeds?"</p>

<p align="justify">"I am afraid that it is. If not, it certainly
will be, if his father does not send him to school. For a little
boy not to be sent to school, is a great misfortune, and I hope you
will think the privilege of going to school a very great one
indeed."</p>

<p align="justify">Harry Williams listened to all his father said,
and, what was better, thought about it, too. He never again asked
to stay home from school.</p>

<h2>JULIAN PARMELEE;</h2>

<h3>OR DISAPPOINTMENT SOMETIMES A BLESSING.</h3>

<p align="justify"><a href="images/0223.jpg"><img src="images/thumb/0223.jpg"
border="0" align="left" alt="Ornamental 'I'"></a>n a pleasant New England village, several years ago, there was
a good deal of excitement produced among the little folks, by the
appearance, on the sign-post, and in the tavern and store, of some
large placards, with very curious and funny pictures upon them.
These placards made known the important fact, that, for the sum of
ninepence, (a shilling, according to the currency of New York,) any
boy and girl in the vicinity might have the pleasure of seeing some
of the most astonishing feats of trained animals ever heard of. On
a certain day there was to be a sort of juggler, who would play on
some kind of instruments. The music made by this man would have the
power of charming the animals&mdash;so the advertisement read&mdash;and the
instant they heard it, they would commence playing their antics.
There was a great black bear who would stand on his head; a dog who
knew almost as much as his master; a cock that could walk on a pair
of high stilts. Then there were learned monkeys, learned pigs, and
I know not what besides.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/0224.jpg"><img src=
"images/thumb/0224.jpg" border="0" alt=
"THE &quot;SHOW.&quot;"></a><br>THE &quot;SHOW.&quot;</p>

<p align="justify">The pictures of these different animals,
performing their several exploits, caused a great deal of wonder
and admiration among the village boys and girls. In cities, where
such exhibitions occur very frequently, such things would not be
much thought of. But it is very different in the country, where
public exhibitions of every sort are "like angels' visits, few and
far between." For nearly a week before the day appointed for this
juggling exhibition, there was nothing talked of in this quiet
village so much as the "show." Ninepences that had been a
twelvemonth in accumulating, were now in great demand; and more
than one boy sighed as he reflected that he had spent his pennies
in candies and other nice things, so that he had none left for the
"show," and secretly resolved that he would be wiser next time, and
not allow his money to slip through his fingers so easily.</p>

<p align="justify">Among those who had the permission of their
parents to visit the exhibition, and who were anxiously longing for
the day to come, were Julian Parmelee and his sister. Julian,
especially&mdash;a boy of about nine years of age&mdash;was almost crazy
with delight, when his mother told him he might go. He jumped,
danced, clapped his hands, shouted, and went through so many
strange manoeuvres, that his elder brother George, who was rather
more sober on the occasion, said he guessed he should not go to the
court-house and pay ninepence to see the show, for he was in a fair
way to get the exhibition at home, for nothing.</p>

<p align="justify">"Oh, mother!" said Julian, "do you really
believe the bear will stand on his head? What a funny sight it must
be! I wonder if they keep the bear chained. I shall take care I do
not get within reach of his paws, I guess. Charley Staples said he
didn't believe it was half so big as the one he saw when he was up
in Vermont. How big is it, mother? as big as our Carlo? Oh, I wish
it was time to go now! I should think monkeys were very funny
creatures. They say there is one in the show that rides a horse,
just like a man. Ha! ha! ha!" And he laughed so loudly that he
waked up the baby in the cradle.</p>

<p align="justify">I do not wonder at all that little Julian was so
much delighted with the idea of going to this exhibition. It was
something entirely new to him; and to children, especially, such
singular feats as these animals were to perform, are always
entertaining. It may, however, admit of a question, whether it is
right, just for our amusement, to inflict so much pain upon these
poor creatures as is necessary to teach them their several parts.
It seems rather cruel. You know what the frogs once said to the
boys, according to the fable, in the matter of stoning: "Young
gentlemen, you do not consider, that while this is sport to you, it
is death to us." These poor bears, and monkeys, and other animals,
while they are going through their education, might use some such
language to their teachers, perhaps, if they had the same faculty
that the fable ascribes to the frogs. But, however that may be, it
was very natural that Julian should be half frantic at the thought
of seeing the show, and quite as natural that Julian's father and
mother should consent to let him go.</p>

<p align="justify">Well, some two days before the exhibition was to
take place, Julian was taken sick. There is a class of
diseases&mdash;such as the measles and the whooping-cough&mdash;which, you
know, almost every boy and girl must have some time or another; and
it is not always left with the children to decide precisely when
they shall take their turn. One of these diseases had made Julian a
call, and insisted on staying with him a week or two. It was the
whooping-cough. Julian wanted to be excused for a few days; but the
old fellow told him, in his wheezing way, that he could not think
of letting him off so long. Julian was disappointed, and cried a
good deal. It did seem rather hard that he must be caged up in his
chamber just at this time. He was not so sick as to make it
necessary to stay at home; but his mother thought it would be wrong
to allow him to go where there were to be so many other children,
because they would be in danger of taking the disease from him. So
it was decided that he could not see the "show;" and he fretted and
stormed, and made himself very unhappy. He was usually a
good-natured boy, but it must be confessed, that he was now quite
out of humor.</p>

<p align="justify">"I don't see what I'm sick for, just when I
wanted to go to the 'show.' I declare, it is too bad. And the
whooping-cough, too! If it was any thing else, I could go. What
under the sun&mdash;"</p>

<p align="justify">"There, Julian, that will do, I think," said his
mother, kindly.</p>

<p align="justify">Julian checked himself, but he could hardly help
muttering something about its being "very provoking."</p>

<p align="justify">Mrs Parmelee was silent for a while, until the
peevishness of her child had a little time to subside, and then she
said&mdash;</p>

<p align="justify">"My dear child, I am sorry that you should feel
so; for you not only make yourself unhappy, but you are finding
fault with God, and you know that is very wrong. God had something
to do with your sickness. He could very easily have prevented it,
if he had chosen to do so. But he did not choose to prevent it,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p align="justify">"Well, why didn't he prevent it, mother?"</p>

<p align="justify">"Hear me through, my child. If he allowed you to
be sick, when he could have kept you well, then it is certain that,
on the whole, he would rather you would be sick. You see this,
don't you, Julian?" "Yes, ma'am. God made me sick, didn't he?"</p>

<p align="justify">"There's no doubt that all diseases are under
his control."</p>

<p align="justify">"Then, mama, I am sure that God&mdash;"</p>

<p align="justify">"Not quite so fast. I want you to see what
you was doing, when you was so peevish a little while ago. You was very
much out of humor. Indeed, I think you showed some anger."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Oh, no, mother, I was not angry."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Perhaps not, my child; but what would you call that spirit, if it was
not anger?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"I was&mdash;I was&mdash;provoked&mdash;I mean vexed, mama."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Well, who vexed you?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Nobody; it was the whooping-cough."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"I'm very sorry that my child should get into such a passion&mdash;or
vexation, whichever it may be&mdash;with the whooping-cough; for you say that
you suppose the disease was under the control of God, so that it must
have been rather an innocent sort of thing, after all. If you should
fall into the mill-pond, and a man standing on the shore should let you
struggle a while before he helped you out, you would get vexed, wouldn't
you?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"I guess I should."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"You would certainly have as much reason for vexation as you have had
this morning. But would you be likely to get vexed with the water?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Why, no, mama. I should be provoked with the man, because he didn't
help me out."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"I thought so. Well, then, don't you think you found fault with God, in
this matter of the whooping-cough?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"It may be so."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"It must be so."
</p>
<p align="justify">
Little Julian was a thoughtful child. He saw that this spirit of
peevishness was very wrong, and that he had murmured against God. He
told his mother that he hoped he should not do so any more. He was
silent for some minutes, and then said&mdash;
</p>
<p align="justify">
"There is one thing I would like to know about, mother; but it may be I
ought not to ask."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"What is it, Julian?" asked his mother.
</p>
<p align="justify">
"If God is kind, and if he loves us, why does he let us get sick? I am
sure you would keep me well all the time, if you could, because you love
me, and because you are good and kind."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"I am glad you asked that question, Julian. There are a great many
things which we cannot understand about the government of God. But I
think I can explain this to you. God, it is true, often disappoints us,
and gives us pain, and makes us weep. This would all seem very strange,
and almost unkind, if we did not know that God has some other end in
view besides making us happy in this life. He is training us for another
world; and if you live to be a man, you will see that such
disappointments as this of yours, for a part of God's plan of fitting
his children for heaven."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"But I think we should be just as good, if he did not make us feel bad
and cry."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"That is your mistake. Do you think you would be just as good a child,
if your parents always humored you, and gave you every plaything you
asked for? Are you quite sure that you would now mind your father and
mother as well, if you had always been allowed to have your own way?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"But you don't make me sick, mother."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"True. We correct you in another way. But we sometimes give you pain,
and make you cry. Did you ever think, when your father reproved you and
punished you, that it was because he did not love you?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Oh, no, mother."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"You can see how your father can be kind and affectionate, and still
give you pain?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Yes, ma'am."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Then cannot you see how God may disappoint <i>his</i> children, and
even make them unhappy for a time, and love them tenderly, too?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Oh, mother, I see it all now! I wonder I never thought of this before!
Well, the whooping-cough is not so bad, after all. I've learned
something by it, at any rate."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Yes, and it may be worth a great deal more to you than the 'show' would
have been."

    STORY OF A STOLEN PEN.
</h2>
<h3>
    WRITTEN BY ITSELF.
</h3>

<p align="justify"><a href="images/0236.jpg"><img src="images/thumb/0236.jpg"
border="0" align="left" alt="Ornamental 'M'"></a>y friend, Theodore Thinker, who is an odd sort of a genius, and
frequently takes up things after a singular fashion, has put into my
hands a paper with this caption: "Story of a Stolen Pen, written by
itself." It seems, from a somewhat lengthy introduction&mdash;too lengthy to
be here quoted&mdash;that the pen once belonged to some editor or another;
and as Theodore has something to do with editorial matters himself, I
should not wonder if he is the one. Some curious readers may be disposed
to inquire how the pen was made to talk so fluently, and perhaps some
others would like to know how it was found in the first place. I can't
answer these reasonable inquiries. The manuscript is entirely silent on
both points. I have my conjectures in relation to the thing&mdash;pretty
strong conjectures, too. I guess the whole story is a fable, to tell the
truth. But never mind. There is a great deal of sense in fables
sometimes; and who knows but there may be some in this? At all events,
we must have
</p>
<h3>
THE STORY.

"THE THIEF STEALING THE PEN."></a><br>THE THIEF STEALING THE PEN.</p>
<p align="justify">
I wish you could have seen the thief in the act of stealing me. What a
sorry face he had on! I send you a rough sketch of him&mdash;for I have a
little talent at drawing&mdash;taken from memory. I was lying on the desk,
close by a manuscript which I had commenced. He snatched me as soon as
the editor's back was turned, and ran out of the office. I wonder the
people did not notice that he was a rogue as he passed along the street.
Why, he stared at every body he met, as if he was afraid they were going
to give him an invitation to walk to the police office. The first thing
he did was to call at several pawnbroker's offices, where he tried to
sell me. No one would give him what he asked. He wanted ten or twelve
dollars, I believe. Well, he gave up that project before night, and I
heard him mutter to himself, "If I only had the money for it!" After
supper he took me into his room, and when he had locked the door fast,
he began to examine me carefully. "It <i>is</i> a beautiful pen," said
he, and then he tried to see how I would write. I should think he was a
pretty good penman. He made a great many flourishes with me, and wrote
his name several times. His name was John Smith, by the way, or at any
rate, that was the signature he made. "What a fine pen this is," said
he; "I never wrote with a better pen in my life. But it won't do for me
to keep it. I shall be found out, if I do. Oh, dear! I wish I had got it
without stealing it. I wonder where I can sell the troublesome thing."
</p>
<p align="justify">
Just then somebody knocked at the door. It was a long time before he let
the person in. He had to think what he would do with me first, and it
took him a good while to put away the paper he had been scribbling on.
"Why, John!" said the man, when he came in, "what makes you look so
frightened? I should think you took me for a tiger, or some such
animal." "I've got the toothache," said the thief, "and I have sent for
the doctor to pull it out. I thought he had come when you knocked. Dear
me! how I dread it! Did you ever have a tooth drawn?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
So you see the fellow told a lie. Those who break one of God's
commandments, are pretty likely to break more before they get through.
My new owner seemed to find it difficult to get to sleep that night, and
after he did get to sleep, he muttered a good deal in his dreams. Once I
heard him say, "No; I bought it of Mr Bagley, in Broadway." I could not
help thinking that he ought to be content with telling lies when he was
awake.
</p>
<p align="justify">
One day he left me on the table when he went out. It was unfortunate for
him. That night I overheard the chambermaid talking with him about it,
and I saw him turn very red in the face. It was evident she did not
believe his story about buying the pen of Mr Bagley, though he told it
over and over again, and made use of a terrible oath, which I dare not
repeat. Poor man! I pitied him. He was certainly very unhappy. He wanted
to sell me very much indeed; but some how or other, no one would give
the price he asked. Perhaps they remembered the saying, "The buyer is as
bad as the thief." He offered me to one man in Pearl street, who seemed
a little disposed to buy. "Wait a minute," said he; and he went into a
back room to speak to somebody. But John Smith thought it would be safer
for him not to wait. I guess he had his mind on the subject of police
officers at that time.
</p>
<p align="justify">
He never went to church with me but once; and then, strange enough, the
minister preached from this text: "The way of transgressors is hard."
I could feel the poor man's heart throb, as the clergyman slowly read
the words. When he went home, he was in great distress&mdash;for the sermon
was a very solemn one&mdash;and he took down from a shelf a small Bible, all
covered with dust, and looked at some words which were written on the
first leaf. I don't wonder he wept, as he read them&mdash;"A mother's gift."
He remembered where the text was, and he turned to it, and read it again
and again. "Yes," said he, "it is true&mdash;too true. But what shall I do?
I have been to the theatre so much now, that I can't be happy unless I
go; and where am I to get the money? I wish I had never begun to steal.
Oh! that was a sad day for me, when I listened to wicked boys, and
robbed that old man's pear tree." I saw then how he first became a
thief; and I thought I should like to have every body know that when
boys are stealing apples, and pears, and peaches, they are serving an
apprenticeship to the business of stealing on a larger scale. I myself
have heard of many a highway robber, who began his career in the orchard
of his neighbor.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Mr Smith did not reform. About three months ago, he stole a horse from
a stable in the upper part of the city, and immediately left for some
place in New Jersey. It was a beautiful horse, but he could not sell
him. People were suspicious. At last he was arrested, and had to go to
Sing Sing prison. I hope he will make up his mind to be an honest man
now; for he has certainly learned, by pretty dear experience, that
"honesty is the best policy." I can't think he would steal any more if
they should let him out. Still, I am not sure. The habit was very
strong.

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
